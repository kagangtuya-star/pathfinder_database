    "text": "You combine the force of multiple blows into a single strike to potentially send a foe flying.",
    "prerequisites": "Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +6, brawlerâ€™s flurry class feature or flurry of blows class feature.",
    "benefit": "When making a full attack against a corporeal foe, you can forgo multiple attacks to make one unarmed strike at your highest base attack bonus. For each attack you forgo, you can add half your Strength modifier (minimum +0) to your damage roll. If you hit with this attack, you can attempt a bull rush combat maneuver check as a free action, substituting your attack roll result for the combat maneuver check result and adding a bonus equal to half your Strength modifier for each attack you forgo. This bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity, and you do not move as a result of the bull rush.",
