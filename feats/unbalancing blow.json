    "text": "With a forceful strike, you throw your foe off-balance.",
    "prerequisites": "Dex 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +4.",
    "benefit": "When using this feat, in addition to dealing damage normally, you force a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to attempt a Reflex saving throw (DC = 10 + half your character level + your Wisdom modifier). A creature that fails this saving throw is flat-footed, and if it is larger than Medium size, it loses any special size modifier to its CMD against effects or combat maneuvers that would move it until its next turn. It is also knocked out of any stance associated with a style feat. You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll; if your attack roll fails, the target is unaffected and your attempt is wasted. You can attempt to use Unbalancing Blow once per day for every 4 character levels you have, but no more than once per round. Creatures immune to tripping are immune to this effect.",
    "prerequisiteKeys": ["improved unarmed strike"]
