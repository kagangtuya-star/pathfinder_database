Your summoned creature gains this evolution. The summoned creature must conform to any limitations of the evolution. (For instance, only a creature with a reach of 10 feet or more can have the pull evolution.)

If you summon more than one creature, you can choose to apply all the evolutions to a single summoned creature, or split them between the creatures summoned.",
