    "benefit": "Once per day as a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, you can make a melee touch attack against a summoned creature to transform it into a magical tattoo on your body as per Tattoo Attunement. When you later transform the creature from tattoo to creature form, you can attempt an opposed Spellcraft check against the creatureâ€™s original summoner; if that summoner is unconscious or dead, you automatically succeed at the check. If you succeed, the creature must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + your caster level) or treat you as the caster of the spell that originally summoned it for the remaining duration of the spell. This is a supernatural ability.",
