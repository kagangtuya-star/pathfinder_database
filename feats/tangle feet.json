    "description": "Creatures who cross your path find themselves tripping over their own feet.",
    "prerequisites": "Dodge, Mobility, Underfoot, goblin, Small size or smaller",
    "benefit": "When you successfully make an Acrobatics check to avoid provoking an attack of opportunity from a larger opponent when you move through its threatened area or its space, you can make that opponent lose its balance until the end of its next turn as a free action. While that creatureâ€™s balance is lost, if it attempts to move, it must make a successful DC 15 Acrobatics check or fall prone, wasting the move action. You can only affect one creature with this effect each round.",
