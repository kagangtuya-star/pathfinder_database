    "source": ["Advanced Player's Guide pg. 165"],
    "description": "Your mastery of alchemy is nearly supernatural.",
    "prerequisites": "Craft (alchemy) 5 ranks",
    "benefit": "You receive a +2 bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks, and you may create mundane alchemical items much more quickly than normal. When making poisons, you can create a number of doses equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) at one time. These additional doses do not increase the time required, but they do increase the raw material cost."
