    "prerequisites": "Any evil alignment, character level 7th",
    "benefit": "You can attract a loyal cohort and a number of intimidated followers to assist in your nefarious deeds. This feat is similar to Leadership, except Vile Leadership rewards—rather than punishes—leaders with cruel reputations or who cause their followers’ deaths. Once you take this feat, you cannot take the Leadership feat without retraining your feat selection (Ultimate Campaign 191). Numerous factors can affect your Vile Leadership score (which acts as a Leadership score for the purpose of feats and abilities that rely on a Leadership score, other than Leadership itself ); work in conjunction with your GM and use the tables below to adjust your Vile Leadership score accordingly. The NPCs you attract must be of a nongood alignment."
