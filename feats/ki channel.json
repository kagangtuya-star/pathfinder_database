    "benefit": "When you channel positive energy to heal living creatures, any creature that could be healed by the channeled energy can choose to regain <i>ki<\/i> from it instead. Affected creatures regain a number of <i>ki<\/i> points equal to the number of dice healed by the channel. A creature regaining <i>ki<\/i> in such a way must either regain <i>ki<\/i> or be healed by the channel (it cannot gain both)."
