    "source": ["Magic Tactics Toolbox pg. 13"],
    "text": "You’ve mastered the art of dismissing certain spells when they become a problem for you or your allies.",
    "benefit": "You can dismiss any pit spell (such as <i>create pit<\/i>, <i>hungry pit<\/i>, <i>spiked pit<\/i>, and similar spells with “pit” in their names) or wall spell (such as <i>wall of fire, wall of ice<\/i>, and similar spells with “wall” in their names) you cast.
