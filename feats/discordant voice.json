    "description": "By singing out a precise tone, you cause discordant vibrations to run through alliesâ€™ weapons.",
    "prerequisites": "Bardic performance class feature, Perform (oratory or sing) 10 ranks",
    "benefit": "Whenever you are using bardic performance to create a spell-like or supernatural effect, allies within 30 feet of you deal an extra 1d6 points of sonic damage with successful weapon attacks. This damage stacks with other energy damage a weapon might deal. Projectile weapons bestow this extra damage on their ammunition, but the extra damage is dealt only if the projectile hits a target within 30 feet of you."
