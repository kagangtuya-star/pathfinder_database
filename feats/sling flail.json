    "description": "You can use your loaded sling to effectively strike at nearby foes.",
    "prerequisites": "Weapon Focus (sling), base attack bonus +1.",
    "benefit": "You can make melee attacks using your loaded sling, using that weapon’s normal statistics but treating it as a flail. Using a sling in this way does not expend mundane ammunition, but magical or masterwork ammunition loses its special properties after a single hit.",
    "special": "Any feats you have that apply when you use a flail also apply when you use a loaded sling as a melee weapon.",
    "staminaSource": ["Pathfinder Unchained pg. 132"],
    "staminaText": "You can spend 2 stamina points to increase the damage dealt by the melee attacks you make with a loaded sling as if your sling were one size category larger than its actual size. For example, a Small sling would deal 1d4 points of damage, while a Medium one would deal 1d6. This benefit lasts until the start of your next turn, and doesn’t stack with other effects that treat the sling as a larger size category unless they increase the sling’s actual size.",

    "description_zh": "你能够将上好石块的投石索当作近战武器来挥舞。",
    "prerequisites_zh": "武器专攻（投石索），基本攻击加值+1。",
    "benefit_zh": "你可以用装填好的投石索发动近战攻击，使用其基本数据、但攻击方式视同链枷。以这种方式使用投石索并不会消耗弹药，但魔法或精制品弹丸会在一次命中后失去原本的强化特性。",
    "special_zh": "你所拥有的任何作用于链枷的专长，都能够在把装填好的投石索当作近战武器时生效。"
