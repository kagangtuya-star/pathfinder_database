    "prerequisites": "Revelation class feature, Improved Unarmed Strike",
    "benefit": "When you gain this feat, choose one revelation that you can use to affect no more than one opponent. If you make a successful unarmed strike against an opponent, in addition to dealing your unarmed strike damage, you can use a swift action to deliver the effects of the chosen revelation to that opponent. Doing so provokes no attacks of opportunity.",
    "special": "You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you take it, you apply it to a different qualifying revelation.",
    "staminaSource": ["Pathfinder Unchained pg. 130"],
    "staminaText": "After hitting with an unarmed strike, you can spend 2 stamina points to apply the effects of your chosen revelation<sup>APG<\/sup> as a free action instead of a swift action. If the chosen revelation has unlimited daily uses, this combat trick costs 5 stamina points instead.",
    "prerequisiteKeys": ["improved unarmed strike"]
