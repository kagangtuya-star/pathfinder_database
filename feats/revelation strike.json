    "prerequisites": "Revelation class feature, Improved Unarmed Strike.",
    "benefit": "When you gain this feat, choose one revelation that you can use to affect no more than one opponent. If you make a successful unarmed strike against an opponent, in addition to dealing your unarmed strike damage, you can use a swift action to deliver the effects of the chosen revelation to that opponent. Doing so provokes no attacks of opportunity.",

    "staminaText": "After hitting with an unarmed strike, you can spend 2 stamina points to apply the effects of your chosen revelation<sup>APG<\/sup> as a free action instead of a swift action. If the chosen revelation has unlimited daily uses, this combat trick costs 5 stamina points instead.",
