    "benefit": "When you use Dimensional Awareness to make an attack of opportunity against a creature being summoned or called into a square you threaten, you can additionally use an immediate action to attempt to send the creature back to its home plane. Attempt a Spellcraft check (DC = 15 + the creature’s CR [minimum 1] + the spell level of the spell that summoned the creature). If you succeed, the creature does not get to act and is immediately sent back to its home plane.",
