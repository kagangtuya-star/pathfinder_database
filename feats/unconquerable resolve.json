    "prerequisites": "Resolve class feature, samurai level 1st (<i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 18<\/i>).",
    "benefit": "Whenever you spend a daily use of the resolve class feature, you gain 1 temporary hit point per Hit Die you have. These temporary hit points are lost first when you take damage, disappear after 1 minute, and are replenished each time you use the resolve class feature. Temporary hit points gained in this way persist for 24 hours and then, if you havenâ€™t lost them, they disappear.",
    "special": "This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time you take it, the number of temporary hit points you gain each time you spend a daily use of the resolve class feature increases by 1 per Hit Die you have."
