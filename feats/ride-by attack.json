    "description": "While mounted and charging, you can move, strike at a foe, and then continue moving.",
    "prerequisites": "Ride 1 rank, Mounted Combat.",
    "benefit": "When you are mounted and use the charge action, you may move and attack as if with a standard charge and then move again (continuing the straight line of the charge).

    "mythicPrerequisites": "Ride-By Attack.<br><br",
    "mythicBenefit": "When you successfully strike an opponent as part of a Ride-By Attack, you can continue to make attacks against successive targets. You can make one additional attack per 3 tiers you possess, but you can’t make more attacks than you could if you were making a full attack. Successive attacks use the lower bonus for multiple attacks, as when making a full attack. You must move at least 10 feet between each attack.",
