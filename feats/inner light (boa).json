    "prerequisites": "Aasimar, <i>daylight <\/i>spell-like ability.",
    "benefit": "Whenever you cast your <i>daylight <\/i>spell-like ability, you do so as if your caster level were one higher. Whenever an enemy successfully counters or dispels your <i>daylight <\/i>spell-like ability, you and any allies within a 20-foot radius gain darkvision 60 feet for a number of rounds equal to your character level. This is a supernatural effect."
