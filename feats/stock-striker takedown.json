    "description": "Your melee strike leaves your target vulnerable to a merciless finishing shot.",
    "prerequisites": "Point-Blank Shot, Stock-Striker Style, Stock-Striker Sweep, base attack bonus +9, pistol-whip gunslinger deed.",
    "benefit": "After you knock a target prone with the pistol-whip deed while using Stock-Striker Style, you can fire one barrel of a loaded firearm you’re wielding at the target as a move action; if your firearm has the scatter weapon quality, you can instead make a scattering shot so long as you include the target in the area of effect. For this attack, you take no attack penalty for making a ranged attack against a prone target, and the critical multiplier of your weapon increases by 1 (to a maximum of ×5).",
