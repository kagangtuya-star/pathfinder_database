    "text": "Your many visits to the <i>Hao Jin Tapestry<\/i> demiplane have made you an expert in long-distance travel.",
    "prerequisites": "Character level 5th.",
    "benefit": "You cast spells of the teleportation subschool as though your caster level were 2 higher, and you treat yourself as one step more familiar when teleporting to an established Pathfinder lodge with the <i>teleport <\/i>spell. If you can teleport as a supernatural ability, you treat your class level as if it were 2 higher when calculating the total distance that you can travel with this ability."
