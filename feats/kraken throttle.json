    "benefit": "The damage that you deal with the Kraken Style feat on a successful grapple combat maneuver check increases to an amount equal to your Wisdom bonus + 2.<br><br> While using this style, you can choke your opponent when you successfully maintain a grapple instead of choosing to damage, move, pin, or tie up your opponent. This suffocates your opponent (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook<\/i> 445). The grappled opponent can take a breath during any round in which you do not maintain the grapple.",
