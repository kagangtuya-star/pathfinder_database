    "description": "You attract a weapon bearer to aid you in your endeavors.",
    "prerequisites": "Character level 4th, proficient with all martial weapons",
    "benefit": "This feat is similar to the Leadership feat, with several exceptions. You can attract only a 1st-level cohort (referred to hereafter as a weapon bearer) with this feat, and canâ€™t recruit followers. You determine your Leadership score according to the rules presented in the Leadership feat, but your weapon bearer is always at least 3 levels lower than yourself."
