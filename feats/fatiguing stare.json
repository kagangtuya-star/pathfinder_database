    "prerequisites": "Mesmerist level 7th, painful stare class feature.",
    "benefit": "When a target takes damage from your painful stare, it must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your mesmerist level + your Charisma modifier) or become fatigued for 1 round. This canâ€™t cause the target to become exhausted, even if the target is already fatigued."
