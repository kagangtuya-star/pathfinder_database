    "text": "Instead of knocking an arrow or ranged attack aside, you can catch it in mid-flight.",
    "prerequisites": "Dex 15, Deflect Arrows, Improved Unarmed Strike.",
    "benefit": "When using the Deflect Arrows feat you may choose to catch the weapon instead of just deflecting it. Thrown weapons can immediately be thrown back as an attack against the original attacker (even though it isn't your turn) or kept for later use.<br><br>You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this feat.",
    "staminaSource": "Pathfinder Unchained pg. 132",
    "staminaText": "When you snatch a thrown weapon, as long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool, you can make a thrown ranged attack with it against any target, not just the original attacker.",

    "mythicText": "You can use the weapons you pluck from the air to immediately make melee attacks.",
    "mythicPrerequisites": "Snatch Arrows.",
    "mythicBenefit": "When you use Snatch Arrows to catch a thrown weapon that can also be used as a melee weapon, you can make a melee attack with it as an immediate action against a foe within the weapon’s melee reach. You can expend one use of mythic power to make this attack without spending an immediate action.",

    "benefit_zh": "当使用“拨挡飞箭”专长时你可以选择抓住那武器而不仅仅只是偏转它。投掷武器可以立刻被扔回去，视为对原攻击者的一次攻击（即使不是你的行动轮）或留下来在以后使用。你必须至少空出一只手（不拿任何东西）来使用此专长。"
