This damage cannot be avoided or reduced in any way. If you are immune to nonlethal damage, you take normal damage instead. If the attack hits, its target takes an additional 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and a â€“4 penalty on concentration checks for 1 round. The penalty is a pain<sup>UM<\/sup> effect.",
