    "prerequisites": "One or more racial spell-like abilities, outsider with the evil subtype",
    "benefit": "Whenever you perform a coup de grace that kills a creature, choose a racial spell-like ability you have that is usable a limited number of times per day (but not more limited, such as once per week or once per month). The spell-like ability’s spell level must be equal to or less than half the victim’s Hit Dice. You regain a use of that spell-like ability. This has no effect if you haven’t expended any uses of that spell-like ability."
