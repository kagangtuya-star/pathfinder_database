    "description": "As a vampire, you may use your create spawn ability to transform a dire bat, dire rat, or wolf into a more powerful vampiric companion.",
    "prerequisites": "Vampire, Charisma 18, animal companion class ability, sufficiently high level (see below)",
    "benefit": "Vampire, Charisma 18, animal companion class ability, sufficiently high level (see below). Benefit: A vampire with this feat can elect to use its create spawn ability on an animal summoned using the child of the night ability (such as a dire bat, dire rat, or wolf ) to create a vampiric animal companion. This decision must be made as a free action as the vampire slays the animal with its blood drain or energy drain ability. The animal rises from death in 1d4 days as a vampiric animal bonded with the vampire who spawned it. Thereafter, the vampiric animal advances in abilities like a normal animal companion as the vampire gains further class levels in the class that granted the animal companion."
