    "benefit": "With a successful Swim check, you can move half your speed as a move action or your full speed as a full-round action. You can run and charge underwater, though the maximum distance you can move while doing so is half the normal maximum distance. Further, while making a charge attack in water or on land, you can add twice your Strength bonus on the damage roll for your first unarmed strike on your turn.",
    "normal": "You cannot charge or run underwater unless you have a swim speed. With an unarmed strike, you usually add your Strength bonus on damage rolls.",
