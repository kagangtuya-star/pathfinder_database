    "description": "When fully focused on your inner self, you can enter a deep meditative state that allows you a more perfect control over your mind and body.",
    "benefit": "When you meditate for at least 1 hour after getting at least 8 hours of rest, you gain special insight into your situation that is nearly impartial, granting you the edge in whatever endeavor matters most during the day. After meditating, you gain a +1 insight bonus that you can apply to any d20 roll over the course of the next 24 hours without using an action. The bonus may be applied after the roll is made, but must be applied before the results of the roll are determined. Once the bonus has been used for the day, you cannot use it again until after you meditate again after another 8 hours of rest. An unused bonus fades after 24 hours."
