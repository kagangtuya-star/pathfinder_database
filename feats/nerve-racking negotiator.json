    "prerequisites": "Persuasive.",
    "benefit": "When you successfully use the Intimidate skill to force an opponent to act friendly toward you, the target must attempt a Will save once the intimidation wears off. The DC is equal to 10 + your number of ranks in Intimidate. If the target fails this save, after the intimidation period expires, the target counts as having the same attitude toward you as it initially did (usually indifferent) and will not report you to the authorities for intimidating it.",
    "normal": "The target of a successful Intimidate check is unfriendly to you and potentially reports you to the authorities after the duration ends.",
