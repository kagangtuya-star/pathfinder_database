    "text": "You have devoted yourself to keeping the traditions of an ancient or lost culture alive and well, and you gain strength from your devotion to the old ways. ",
    "prerequisites": "Knowledge (history) 3 ranks, must have a connection to a lost culture (see text).",
    "benefit": "Each lost culture has its own daily ritual, but none of them take more than 1 hour per day to perform. Once you’ve performed the daily ritual, you gain the benefit of a special ability or resistance as indicated in the Daily Ritual entry for the culture in question. Specific cultures and their rituals are listed below.<br><br> If you have at least 12 Hit Dice, you also gain the first boon granted by your lost culture upon undertaking its daily ritual. If you have at least 16 Hit Dice, you also gain the lost culture’s second boon. If you have 20 Hit Dice or more, you also gain the lost culture’s third boon. Each boon is a spell-like ability that you can cast once per day. Your caster level for these boons is equal to your Hit Dice, and the saving throw DC is based on your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest).<br><br> For the purposes of this feat, you are considered to have a connection to a lost culture if you have a relic or object from that civilization, have extensively researched that culture, or are descended—directly or culturally—from that culture’s people. Once you have chosen a lost culture, you cannot change it without your GM’s permission. At the GM’s discretion, other types of connections might also apply. Typically, you can have a connection to only one lost civilization. If you ever fail to perform a daily ritual, you lose all access to the benefits and boons granted by this feat until the time you next perform the daily ritual."
