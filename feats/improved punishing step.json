    "prerequisites": "Dex 13, Dodge, Punishing Step, base attack bonus +8",
    "benefit": "Your bonus to AC from the Dodge feat increases to +2 against charge attacks. When a creature charges you and misses with its attack, it loses its Dexterity bonus to AC against the next melee attack you make against it before the end of your next turn. If a creature misses with multiple attacks (such as when using the pounce ability), you can make one such attack against the creature’s flat-footed AC before the end of your next turn for each of that creature’s attacks that missed you.",
