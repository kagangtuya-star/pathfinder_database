    "prerequisites": "Base attack bonus +1",
    "benefit": "When fighting with a club, quarterstaff, dan bong, sap, or tonfa with which you are proficient, you gain a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls as though it were a masterwork weapon. If the weapon actually is a masterwork weapon, it instead counts as having the blocking, disarm, distracting, performance, and trip special weapon qualities, even if the weapon normally doesnâ€™t have them."
