    "description": "Your strikes are so powerful that they harm both your target and any force possessing it.",
    "prerequisites": "Vital Strike, base attack bonus +6.",
    "benefit": "Whenever you use the attack action against a creature that is possessed, both the creature and any creature possessing it are damaged by your attack (the amount of damage includes your weaponâ€™s damage dice, your Strength modifier, weapon special abilities, and so on). The possessing creature can attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your base attack bonus + your Charisma modifier) to halve the damage. Damage reduction applies normally against this attack, but incorporeal creatures take full damage from this attack as if they were corporeal.",
