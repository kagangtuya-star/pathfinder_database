You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against your mark. These bonuses last for 1 minute, until you designate a new mark, or until the mark is dead. After you have declared a creature as your mark, it can’t be your mark again for another 24 hours."
