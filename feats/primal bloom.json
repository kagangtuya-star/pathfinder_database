    "prerequisites": "Knowledge (planes) 10 ranks",
    "benefit": "As a standard action, you can create a 50-foot-radius spread of primal fey influence centered on yourself. This area is stationary and lasts for 1 minute. The affected area gains the wild magic planar trait (see page 63), except that the DC of the caster level check increases by 5. If the area already has the wild magic planar trait, the DC of the caster level check increases by 10 instead."
