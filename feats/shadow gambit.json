    "description": "You can tap into the Plane of Shadow to momentarily lend reality to one of your illusion (figment) spells.",
    "prerequisites": "Spell Focus (illusion), caster level 5th",
    "benefit": "As a standard action, you can draw upon energies from the Plane of Shadow to cause an ongoing figment spell you cast to damage a foe as if the illusion were real. The illusion must be one you retain ongoing control of, such as <i>minor image<\/i>, and the target must be both visible to you and within or adjacent to the area of your illusion. Using this feat immediately ends the figmentâ€™s duration.",
