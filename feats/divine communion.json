    "text": "Your close, personal connection with your deity grants you insight into his or her wishes.",
    "prerequisites": "Wisdom 13, alignment must match that of your worshiped deity.",
    "benefit": "Once per day as a swift action, you can ponder whether or not your deity would approve or disapprove of a particular course of action, and whether that action would impact your alignment. The GM decides if the action is one your deity would approve of, and if it is, you gain an insight bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1) on any d20 roll made in association with that action during this round. For every 3 ranks you have in Knowledge (religion), you can use this ability an additional time per day, to a maximum of 6 times a day."
