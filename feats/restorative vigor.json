You can choose separately for each vigor point spent. For example, if you spend 2 vigor points, you could regain 2d6 hit points; recover 2d3 points of ability damage from up to two physical ability scores total; or regain 1d6 hit points and recover from 1d3 points of ability damage from one physical ability score.",
