    "description": "You have mastered a deadly fighting form inspired by the hideous attacks of the barbed devil.",
    "prerequisites": "Improved Unarmed Strike, Weapon Focus (unarmed strike)",
    "benefit": "Your unarmed attacks can deal either bludgeoning or piercing damage. You decide which type of damage you deal whenever you attack a foe, but you may only choose one type at a time. If you critically hit a foe with your unarmed strike while doing piercing damage, the additional pain caused by the strike causes the foe to become sickened for 1 round (or staggered for 1 round if the target is already sickened). Multiple critical hits in a round against a single foe do not increase the duration of the sickened or staggered condition.",
    "special": "Hamatulatsu may be selected as a substitute bonus feat at 6th level by a monk even if the monk does not otherwise meet the prerequisites. This fighting style is normally only taught to women of the Sisterhood of the Golden Erinyes.",
    "staminaSource": ["Weapon Master's Handbook pg. 25"],
    "staminaText": "By spending 5 stamina points, you can treat a hit with an unarmed strike as a critical hit for the purpose of determining the benefits that you gain from Hamatulatsu.",
