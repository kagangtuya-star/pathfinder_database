    "description": "You intimidate weaker allies into reckless ferocity.",
    "prerequisites": "Demoralizing Lash, Intimidate 5 ranks, hobgoblin",
    "benefit": "As a standard action, you spur an ally, who must have fewer Hit Dice than yourself, to reckless effort. For 1 minute, the ally gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and Will saves against mind-affecting effects. However, the ally also takes a â€“2 penalty to AC and on skill checks. To affect an unwilling ally, you must succeed at an Intimidate check with the same DC used to demoralize your ally.",
    "special": "If you have 10 or more ranks in Intimidate, the morale bonus increases to +2.",
