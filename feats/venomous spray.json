    "description": "You can spit your poison into a nearby opponent’s face.",
    "prerequisites": "Serpentfolk",
    "benefit": "You can spit venom as a secondary ranged attack with a range of 5 feet. This is a natural attack and doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity. A target struck by your venom must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = your poison DC) or be blinded for 1d4 rounds and suffer the normal effects of your poison. You can’t use this attack during any round in which you make a bite attack (and vice versa). After spitting venom, you are unable to use your poisonous bite or to spit venom for 1d4 rounds."
