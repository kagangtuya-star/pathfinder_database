    "description": "You can manipulate the luminescence of magic weapons.",
    "prerequisites": "Use Magic Device 5 ranks, ability to cast <i>darkness<\/i>.",
    "benefit": "When wielding a magic weapon that sheds light or that features a luminescent quality, such as a <i>flaming<\/i> or <i>brilliant energy<\/i> weapon, you can deactivate that illumination as a swift action. You can reignite the illumination at any time as a free action. Any intrinsic magic properties that would force the weapon to shed light, such as the extra damage of a <i>flaming<\/i> weapon, do not function while the illumination is deactivated, and the “significant portion” of a <i>brilliant energy<\/i> weapon that is normally made of light ceases to exist.<br><br> If a weapon affected by this ability ever leaves your possession (for instance, if you drop the weapon or pass it to another creature), its illumination and related abilities instantly return."
