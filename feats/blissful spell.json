    "benefit": "You can alter any spell that targets a single creature to become a blissful spell, although the exact effects of the metamagic vary depending on whether the spell is beneficial or offensive. A creature successfully hit by an offensive blissful spell (if the spell requires an attack roll) or that fails its saving throw against an offensive blissful spell takes a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls for 1 round. A beneficial blissful spell instead grants affected creatures a +2 morale bonus on skill checks and saving throws for 1 round in addition to its normal effects. A blissful spell gains the good descriptor, and the additional effect is a mind-affecting compulsion effect."
