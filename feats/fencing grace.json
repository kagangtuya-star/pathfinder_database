You do not gain this benefit while fighting with two weapons or using flurry of blows, or anytime another hand is otherwise occupied.<br><br> In addition, if you have the panache<sup>ACG<\/sup> class feature, you gain a +2 bonus to your CMD against attempts to disarm you of your rapier while you have at least 1 panache point.",
