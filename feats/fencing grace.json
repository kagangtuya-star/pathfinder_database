    "prerequisites": "Dex 13, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus (rapier)",
    "benefit": "When wielding a rapier one-handed, you can add your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to that weaponâ€™s damage. The rapier must be one appropriate for your size. You do not gain this benefit while fighting with two weapons or using flurry of blows, or anytime another hand is otherwise occupied.",
