    "text": "Your magic holds all the intricacies of Axis’s idealized laws, enforcing their strictures upon your enemies.",
    "benefit": "You can alter any spell that targets a single creature to become an authoritative spell. When you cast an authoritative spell, choose one of the following activities to prohibit: move closer to you, move away from you, make a melee weapon attack, make a ranged weapon attack, cast an offensive spell, or cast a nonoffensive spell. A creature that is affected by the spell and fails its saving throw against that spell (if the spell allows a saving throw to resist) cannot perform any action of the selected type on its next turn. An authoritative spell gains the lawful descriptor, and the additional effect is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.<br><br> An authoritative spell uses a spell slot 2 levels higher than the spell’s normal spell level. Spells with the chaotic descriptor can’t be authoritative spells."
