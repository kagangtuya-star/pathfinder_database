    "description": "Your ability to find loopholes in technical, legalistic writing extends even to magical writing on scrolls.",
    "prerequisites": "Scribe Scroll, Linguistics 3 ranks",
    "benefit": "Any Wisdom check you attempt to avoid a mishap when casting a spell from a scroll fails only on a natural 1. When you cast a spell from a scroll, you can attempt a caster level check with a DC equal to 25 + the scroll’s caster level as a free action. If you succeed, the magical writing does not vanish for 1 round; if the spell’s casting time is no longer than a standard action, the scroll can be used again in the following round before its writing fades. You can’t use this feat on a scroll a second time, and you can’t use this feat if the spell on the scroll requires a material component worth more than 10 gp.",
