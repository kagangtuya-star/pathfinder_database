    "text": "Your humiliating strikes decrease a foeâ€™s morale.",
    "prerequisites": "Combat Reflexes, Diabolic Style; Vital Strike; Improved Unarmed Strike or Weapon Focus (unarmed strike); base attack bonus +8 or monk level 7th.",
    "benefit": "When you successfully stagger a foe with an unarmed strike using Diabolic Style, the target becomes further humiliated. The target cannot gain the benefit of any morale bonus for 1 minute after being staggered in this way, and for the duration of that minute, any additional staggered effects it suffers from your attacks of opportunity last for 2 rounds rather than 1. The durations of multiple staggered effects administered in this way stack.",
