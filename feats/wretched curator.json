    "description": "Some fools fear the written word, but you that understand knowledge—all knowledge—is a valuable tool, and restricting it out of superstition is abominable in your eyes.",
    "prerequisites": "You must have purchased a scroll or spellbook containing a spell with the evil descriptor in a place where such dealings are illegal, or must have the Secret Society Inductee or Diabolical Upbringing background.",
    "benefit": "You can always purchase potions and scrolls of spells with the evil descriptor at a 10% discount, even if they are not normally available in a settlement because of its size or the local laws. You gain a +4 bonus on Knowledge (arcana), Spellcraft, and Use Magic Device checks related to spells with the evil descriptor or evil written works."
