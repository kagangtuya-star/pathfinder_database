    "descriptors": ["Story"],
    "source": ["Agents of Evil pg. 9"],
    "text": "Some fools fear the written word, but you that understand knowledge—all knowledge—is a valuable tool, and restricting it out of superstition is abominable in your eyes.",
    "prerequisites": "You must have purchased a scroll or spellbook containing a spell with the evil descriptor in a place where such dealings are illegal, or must have the Secret Society Inductee or Diabolical Upbringing background.",
    "benefit": "You can always purchase potions and scrolls of spells with the evil descriptor at a 10% discount, even if they are not normally available in a settlement because of its size or the local laws. You gain a +4 bonus on Knowledge (arcana), Spellcraft, and Use Magic Device checks related to spells with the evil descriptor or evil written works.",
    "goal": "You must own scrolls of spells with the evil descriptor or tomes of forbidden lore worth a total of 50 gp per character level, and be the primary caster of a successful occult ritual (<i>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures<\/i> 208) of at least 5th level that has the evil descriptor.",
    "completionBenefit": "Every time you cast a spell with the evil descriptor, you can remove that descriptor from the spell and treat yourself as a neutral-aligned caster for the purpose of determining the spell’s effects, circumventing defenses such as <i>protection from evil<\/i> and preventing detection via <i>detect evil<\/i> and similar effects. If you cast a spell with the evil descriptor and do not remove that descriptor, you instead gain 2 temporary hit points per spell level. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour."
