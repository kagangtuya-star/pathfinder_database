    "descriptors": ["Story"],
    "source": ["Horror Adventures pg. 95"],
    "description": "An evil person or entity has become obsessed with your resemblance to a lost loved one.",
    "prerequisites": "You resemble a lost loved one of an evil creature who would otherwise be a challenging foe. The likeness is close enough for you to be mistaken as the former loved one's reincarnation, or you might be that loved one reborn in a new life. Alternately, the creature might be a former lover who has become evil and wishes to resume the relationship. This unwanted relationship must be contrary to your alignment or long-term goals. Thematically appropriate backgrounds include Born out of Time, Current Lover, Reincarnated, The Lover, and Troubled First Love (all of which are found in Ultimate Campaign)",
    "benefit": "You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against enchantment effects and a +2 bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks to influence your would-be love or her minions and servants."
