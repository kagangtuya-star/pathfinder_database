    "description": "You can coax greater power out of magical devices.",
    "prerequisites": "Use Magic Device 12 ranks.",
    "benefit": "If you exceed the Use Magic Device DC to activate a spell completion or spell trigger item by 5 or more, you can increase the item’s caster level by 1 for determining the spell’s effect. Alternatively, if you exceed the Use Magic Device DC by 10 or more when activating a magic item with charges, you can expend an additional charge to increase the caster level by 2 levels. Regardless, you can’t increase an item’s caster level to one that is higher than your own caster level."
