    "benefit": "You can replace one of your attacks at your highest base attack bonus each round with a spellrending strike. If your spellrending strike hits, it deals no damage, but you can attempt to dispel a harmless divine spell affecting this target as per <i>dispel magic<\/i>, with a caster level equal to your character level. If you succeed at your dispel check, the target is sickened as if you had interrupted the spell with Asura Style and receives no saving throw to reduce the sickened duration.",
