    "description": "You gain the service of a monstrous companion or mount.",
    "prerequisites": "Animal companion or mount class feature, character level 7th, half-orc or orc",
    "benefit": "Select one of the following creature types: elephant, pteranodon, rhinoceros, stegosaurus, or triceratops. Add this creature type to your list of possible animal companions or mounts. When summoning a creature of the selected type to serve as a mount or companion, treat your effective druid level as if it were two levels higher (to a maximum of your character level). If the creature is large enough for you to ride, it gains the combat training general purpose (see Handle Animal) at no cost."
