    "description": "You recruit a page who heralds your approach and has the ability to smooth the path of your diplomatic missions.",
    "prerequisites": "Character level 4th, proficiency with martial weapons",
    "benefit": "This feat is similar to the Leadership feat, with several exceptions. You can attract only a 1st-level cohort (referred to hereafter as a page) with this feat, and canâ€™t recruit followers. You determine your Leadership score according to the rules presented in the Leadership feat, but your page is always at least 3 levels lower than your level."
