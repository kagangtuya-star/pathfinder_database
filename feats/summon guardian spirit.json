    "description": "A guardian spirit has selected you as its ward.",
    "prerequisites": "Ability to cast <i>summon monster III<\/i> or <i>summon nature's ally III<\/i>",
    "benefit": "Select one creature that qualifies to be an improved familiar, and apply the guardian spirit template (see below) to it. That creature is added to either your <i>summon monster III<\/i> or <i>summon nature’s ally III<\/i> list as a summonable creature. When you summon your guardian spirit, the duration of the spell you use to summon it is 1 minute per level. A guardian spirit is always exactly the same creature, with memory of all the events that occurred while previously summoned; multiple versions of it can’t be summoned. If it’s killed while summoned, it cannot be summoned again for 24 hours."
