    "source": ["Planar Adventures pg. 33"],
    "description": "By decree of Asmodeus, Hell is a place antithetical to free will; wielding its power humbles foes and renders them vulnerable to your commands. Those who you target with a pointed rebuke feel as if the disdain of Hell itself has turned its attention to their acts.",
    "prerequisites": "Knowledge (planes) 5 ranks",
    "benefit": "As a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack. A creature successfully hit by this touch attack must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half your level + your Charisma modifier) or be staggered until the end of your next turn. If you use Tyrantâ€™s Rebuke on a creature that is already staggered by this effect and it fails its Will save, it takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage in addition to being staggered."
