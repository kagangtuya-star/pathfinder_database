    "benefit": "When you use Vital Strike (or Improved Vital Strike or Greater Vital Strike), you cause the foliage in the area to reach out and entangle your foe (as the condition) if it fails a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier). The effect lasts for 1 minute or until the enemy breaks free with a successful Strength check or an Escape Artist check (DC = the effectâ€™s saving throw DC), whichever comes first.<br><br> You can use this benefit a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). You can choose to use this ability as a free action after you hit the enemy with the attack. This is a supernatural ability.",
