    "prerequisites": "Mesmerist tricks class feature.",
    "benefit": "Whenever you implant a mesmerist trick in a target, you can designate that trick as a swap trick. The implanted mesmerist trick functions as normal, except you can trigger the swap trick as a standard action by touching the target. When the swap trick is triggered in this manner, the target “loses” the swap trick and instead becomes implanted with any one mesmerist trick that you know in its place. Implanting a mesmerist trick in a target in this manner doesn’t count against your number of daily uses of the mesmerist trick class feature."
