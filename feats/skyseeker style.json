    "benefit": "Once per round, when an opponent attacks you with a reach weapon, you can take a 5-foot step towards your opponent as an immediate action. If the movement takes you to a square that the opponent’s reach weapon does not threaten, you receive a +4 bonus to AC against that attack. If you take this step, you cannot take a 5-foot step during your next turn. If you take an action to move during your next turn, subtract 5 feet from your total available movement.",
