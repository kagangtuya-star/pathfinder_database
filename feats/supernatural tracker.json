    "description": "Combining magical detection with your tracking skills allows you to sense and track a creature’s lingering presence.",
    "prerequisites": "Survival 1 rank, ability to cast a detect spell.",
    "benefit": "You can cast a detect spell that specifies a creature type, such as <i>detect animals and plants<\/i> or <i>detect undead<\/i>, to augment your ability to track such creatures instead of the spell’s normal benefit; you can see a soft glow that highlights tracks of passage left by creatures of that type. For a duration of 1 hour per level of the spell, you gain a bonus equal to 5 + the spell’s level on Survival checks to track creatures of the specified type. For this duration, you can track such creatures as if you are trained in the Survival skill, even if you are not."
