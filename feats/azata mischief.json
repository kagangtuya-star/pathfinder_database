    "description": "You move with uncommon grace that disorients enemies, causing foes that strike at you to overreach and stumble.",
    "prerequisites": "Agile Maneuvers, Azata Style, Dodge, Mobility, base attack bonus +6.",
    "benefit": "While using Azata Style, whenever an opponent misses you with an attack of opportunity provoked by your movement through its threatened squares, you can attempt a trip combat maneuver against that creature at the end of your turn as a swift action, provided you are still adjacent to the creature when you end your movement for the round. This trip attempt does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You gain a bonus on your combat maneuver check equal to any bonuses to AC you gain against attacks of opportunity provoked by movement (such as that granted by the Mobility feat).",
