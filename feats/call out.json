    "description": "A well-crafted insult forces an opponent to duel you.",
    "benefit": "As a standard action, you can make an Intimidate check against a hostile target within 30 feet that can clearly see and hear you. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + your opponent’s Hit Dice + its Wisdom modifier. If the target is trained in Sense Motive, the DC is instead equal to 10 + your opponent’s Sense Motive bonus, if higher. If you succeed at this check, the target enters a duel with you (<i>Ultimate Combat<\/i> 150). The target cannot withdraw from the duel for 1 round + 1 round for every 5 by which the check beat the DC."
