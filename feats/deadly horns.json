    "description": "Many tieflings bear horns as an overt mark of their fiendish heritage; you have learned to use yours as a weapon.",
    "prerequisites": "Base attack bonus +1, tiefling.",
    "benefit": "You gain a gore natural attack that deals 1d6 points of damage. Due to the awkwardness of attacking this way, you canâ€™t make a gore attack and other natural weapon attacks as part of the same full attack. Treat your gore attack as a secondary attack if you also attack with a manufactured weapon as part of a full attack in a round."
