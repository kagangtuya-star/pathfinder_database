    "description": "You can disrupt an enemy caster’s spells to fuel your own arcane power.",
    "prerequisites": "Spell recall class feature, Spellcraft 5 ranks",
    "benefit": "When you use a melee attack to successfully disrupt an arcane spellcaster’s spell, you can immediately use your spell recall class feature to regain a magus spell you have already cast. This ability functions as if you had expended a number of points from your arcane pool equal to the level of the spell you disrupted, up to the maximum level spell you can cast."
