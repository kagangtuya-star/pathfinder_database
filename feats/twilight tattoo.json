    "description": "You have a special tattoo that identifies you as a Twilight Talon when you speak a designated command word.",
    "prerequisites": "Wis 13, affiliated with the Twilight Talons",
    "benefit": "You gain an invisible magical tattoo that identifies you as a member of the Twilight Talons. When you speak the command word, the tattoo becomes visible for 1 round before fading again. The tattoo has no magical aura when not visible and is not an illusion; it canâ€™t be observed through magical means. (The command word causes the tattoo to manifest rather than ending the magic concealing it.)"
