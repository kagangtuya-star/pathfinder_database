    "description": "You can change into a fox in addition to your other forms.",
    "prerequisites": "Cha 13, base attack bonus +3, kitsune",
    "benefit": "You can take the form of a fox (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 <\/i>112) whose appearance is static and cannot be changed each time you assume this form. Your bite attackâ€™s damage is reduced to 1d3 points of damage on a hit, but you gain a +10 racial bonus on Disguise checks made to appear as a fox. Changing from kitsune to fox shape is a standard action. This ability otherwise functions as <i>beast shape II<\/i>, and your ability scores change accordingly."
