    "description": "Prismatic sand refracts the spatial energies of your conjuration magic, creating a magical distortion.",
    "benefit": "When you cast a conjuration spell using prismatic sand as an esoteric material component, select one creature summoned, called, or moved from another plane by your spell. For 1 round, that creature hasnâ€™t fully phased onto the current plane, causing all attacks against it to suffer a 20% miss chance (attacks without attack rolls deal 20% less damage)."
