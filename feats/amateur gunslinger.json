    "descriptors": ["Combat"],
    "source": ["Ultimate Combat pg. 89"],
    "description": "Although you are not a gunslinger, you have and can use grit.",
    "prerequisites": "You have no levels in a class that has the grit class feature",
    "benefit": "You gain a small amount of grit and the ability to perform a single 1st-level deed from the gunslinger deed class feature. At the start of the day, you gain 1 grit point, though throughout the day you can gain grit points up to a maximum of your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). You can regain grit using the rules for the gunslingerâ€™s grit class feature (see page 9). You can spend this grit to perform the 1st-level deed you chose upon taking this feat, and any other deed you have gained through feats or magic items.",
    "special": "If you gain levels in a class that grants the grit class feature, you can immediately trade this feat for the Extra Grit feat.",
    "staminaSource": ["Pathfinder Unchained pg. 113"],
    "staminaText": "Choose a second 1st-level gunslinger deed. You can spend grit to use this deed, or you can spend 5 stamina points to use either of your deeds in place of grit. If you gain levels in a class that grants the grit class feature, you retain the ability to spend 5 stamina points in place of grit when using any of your 1st-level deeds, and this becomes a combat trick of the Extra Grit<sup>UC<\/sup> feat (even though that feat is not a combat feat)."
