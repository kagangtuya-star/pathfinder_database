    "description": "You have further refined your combination of elemental power and spellcasting with metamagic techniques.",
    "prerequisites": "Metakinesis class feature.",
    "benefit": "Choose a metamagic feat from the following list: Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Intuitive Spell<sup>OA<\/sup>, Logical Spell<sup>OA<\/sup>, Quicken Spell, Reach Spell<sup>APG<\/sup>, or Tenacious Spell<i>UI<\/i>. When casting a spell via Kinetic Invocation, you can increase its burn cost to augment the spell with that metamagic feat.<br><br> The burn cost increase is equal to the spell level increase applied by the feat. Augmenting a spell increases its casting time as if it were cast spontaneously.",
    "special": "You can take this feat more than once. Each time you take this feat, select another metamagic feat; you can augment a spell with multiple feats by accepting additional points of burn equal to the total increased spell level."
