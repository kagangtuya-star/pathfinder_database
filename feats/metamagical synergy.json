    "benefit": "If all three coven members with this feat cast the same spell in the same round, you can combine your efforts, resolving the spell only on the last member’s initiative. The effects of the spell are resolved only once, but the coven can apply one of the following metamagic feats without altering the spell slot used: Empower Spell, Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Maximize Spell, or Widen Spell. Casters do not need the appropriate metamagic feat to apply it via this feat. The synergy spell resolves using the caster level, save DC, and other modifiers of the caster of the coven’s choice. The spell does not apply other metamagic feats unless all three members included the same feat in their casting. This ability cannot be used if the chosen metamagic feat would normally alter a spell to use a spell slot above 9th level.",
