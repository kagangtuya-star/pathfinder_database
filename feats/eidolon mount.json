    "description": "Your eidolon is capable of carrying you into combat with great skill.",
    "prerequisites": "Eidolon able to choose quadruped or serpentine as a base form",
    "benefit": "Your eidolon is capable of serving you as a combat-trained mount. If the eidolon’s base form is not quadruped or serpentine, it also gains the ability to transmute its physical body into a form suitable for you to ride. This functions as the change shape ability, except the eidolon’s base form changes to either quadruped or serpentine and its size changes to be one size category larger than its summoner’s base size. Unlike other changes to size, this ability doesn’t increase the eidolon’s ability scores, reach, or weapon damage beyond that of its true form. (However, if the eidolon’s size is reduced by this ability, its reach and weapon damage are adjusted accordingly.)"
