    "description": "You are especially responsive to curative magic that soothes your wounds with particular effectiveness.",
    "benefit": "Whenever a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability heals you up to your maximum number of hit points, any excess hit points persist for 1 round per level as temporary hit points (up to a maximum number of hit points equal to 1/2 your character level).<br><br> If the healing from the spell or spell-like ability would normally persist as temporary hit points (such as if the spell’s caster were an oracle of life with the spirit boost revelation), you instead add 1/2 your character level to the spell’s caster’s level to determine the total number of temporary hit points that you gain. For instance, if a 4th-level oracle of life with the spirit boost revelation heals a 4th-level fighter with this feat, up to 6 points of healing could become temporary hit points for the fighter (the oracle’s caster level + 1/2 the fighter’s level)."
