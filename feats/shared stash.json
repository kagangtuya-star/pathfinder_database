    "description": "You are adept at borrowing from your allies even in the middle of combat.",
    "prerequisites": "Quick Draw, base attack bonus +1, Sleight of Hand 1 rank, swarming racial trait",
    "benefit": "While you are in the same square as a willing ally who also has this feat, you can draw a weapon from that creature as a free action or draw a hidden weapon or any other object as a move action. You can also take a held object from a willing ally in the same square as you as a free action. Drawing or taking an object (but not a weapon) in this way provokes an attack of opportunity.",
    "prerequisiteKeys": ["quick draw"]
