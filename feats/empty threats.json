    "description": "You have a gift for making authentic-sounding threats you never intend to follow through on.",
    "prerequisites": "Bluff 5 ranks.",
    "benefit": "You can use the Bluff skill to demoralize opponents in combat instead of Intimidate. You can attempt a Bluff check in place of an Intimidate check when using the Dazzling Display feat and feats that list Dazzling Display as a prerequisite. If you use the Bluff skill to demoralize, you cannot use it to feint until the beginning of your next turn, and vice versa."
