    "description": "You can share spells with those you have a magical connection with. ",
    "prerequisites": "Spellcraft 10 ranks, ability to acquire an animal companion, eidolon, familiar, or special mount",
    "benefit": "Any non-instantaneous spell (but not any spell-like ability) you cast on yourself can also affect a creature bonded to you (such as an animal companion, eidolon, familiar, or special mount). The creature must be within 5 feet of you at the time of casting to receive the benefit. The spellâ€™s duration is halved between you and your bonded creature (for example, a spell with a duration of 1 hour has a duration of 30 minutes for both you and your bonded creature)."
