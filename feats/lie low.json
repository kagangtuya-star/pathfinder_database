    "description": "Youâ€™re even harder to see when prone than most are.",
    "benefit": "If you have been prone since the end of your last turn, the penalty on Perception checks for others to notice you increases by 1 for every 20 feet between you and the observer, to a maximum increase of 5 at 100 feet. This stacks with the normal modifier for distance."
