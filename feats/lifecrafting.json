    "benefit": "By completing a unique ritual, you can create a wyrwood. While you can use any Small wooden construct to create the base of a wyrwood, infusing it with life and consciousness requires a specific process. The process requires a flawless <i>ioun stone<\/i> worth at least 10,000 gp. For the ritual to succeed, you must spend 1 month in complete isolation with the construct that will become a wyrwood. Each week, you must succeed at a DC 30 Craft (carpentry) or Craft (sculpture) check. Failure requires you to start again, although the materials can be reused. Over this time, the construct reshapes itself around the <i>ioun stone<\/i> until it finds the form it will take permanentlyâ€” thus even non-humanoid constructs become humanoid as they become wyrwoods. While wyrwoods are born as fully formed adults, they lack any skill or training, so they have only 1 level in the commoner class.",
