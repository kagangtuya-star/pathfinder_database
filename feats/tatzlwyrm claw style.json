    "benefit": "You can choose for your unarmed attacks to deal slashing damage. If you strike a target that has another creature grappled or pinned, as a swift action you can immediately attempt a grapple combat maneuver check against the target’s CMD. If you succeed at the check, you can force the target to release a grappled creature or switch a pinned creature to being merely grappled.",
