    "prerequisites": "Anchoring aura class feature",
    "benefit": "When an evil outsider uses a calling, summoning, or teleportation effect, or any ability that physically transports a creature to or from another plane (such as <i>blink <\/i>or <i>etherealness<\/i>) within your anchoring aura, it takes damage equal to 4d8 + your Charisma modifier. This damage comes from holy power and is not subject to damage reduction, energy immunities, or energy resistances."
