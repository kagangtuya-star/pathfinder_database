    "description": "You are able to weave psychic contingencies into your target’s mind.",
    "prerequisites": "Masterful tricks class feature, ability to cast 4th-level mesmerist spells",
    "benefit": "You can implant a spell trick in a target’s mind, following the same rules and limitations for implanting mesmerist tricks. A spell trick acts as a mesmerist trick in all ways, except you specify under what circumstances the spell trick can be triggered (known as the triggering condition) and what the trick’s effects are once it is triggered. When determining the spell trick’s effects, choose one mesmerist spell that you know. The spell trick duplicates the effects of the chosen spell when triggered, as if you had cast the spell using a mesmerist spell slot."
