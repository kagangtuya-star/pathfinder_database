    "text": "When you channel positive energy, you cause vines to grow and ensnare enemies.",
    "prerequisites": "Channel positive energy class feature, Plant domain.",
    "benefit": "By expending two additional uses when you channel energy, you cause the ground in the area of effect to erupt in a growth of vines. You create a number of vine growths (AC 10, 5 hp) equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Each growth of vines occupies 1 5-foot square of your choosing. As an immediate action when you use this ability, and again as a free action at the start of your turn, you can command the vines to wrap around the legs of a creature occupying the square. The creature must succeed at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half your class level + your Charisma modifier) or become rooted to the spot. The vines last a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). The ground must be composed of a material able to support plant life (such as soil)."
