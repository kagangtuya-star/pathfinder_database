    "description": "You remain briefly translucent after losing <i>invisibility<\/i>.",
    "prerequisites": "Duergar",
    "benefit": "When your <i>invisibility <\/i>ends, you gain concealment for 1 round per minute of duration the invisibility effect had remaining (minimum 1 round). This only occurs if the invisibility is from your racial spell-like ability or a spell you cast. Effects that negate invisibility negate this concealment."
