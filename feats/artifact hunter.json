    "description": "You seek an artifact—either a specific one or merely any item of legendary prowess—with dogged tenacity.",
    "prerequisites": "You must have come within sight of a legendary artifact at some point in your past",
    "benefit": "You gain a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks when emulating a class feature, ability score, race, or alignment. If you have 10 or more ranks in Use Magic Device, this bonus increases to +4. In addition, once per day, instead of attempting a Use Magic Device check normally, you can choose to determine the result as if you had rolled a 15. If you have 10 or more ranks in Use Magic Device, you can use this ability twice per day."
