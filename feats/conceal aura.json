    "text": "You can weaken your alignment aura to hide the true extent of your faith.",
    "prerequisites": "Chaotic, evil, good, or lawful alignment.",
    "benefit": "As a full-round action, you can reduce the power of the aura generated by your alignment for 1 minute. During this time, for the purposes of spells that detect alignment, your auraâ€™s power is lessened by one step (for example, if you are a 12th-level neutral good fighter, your aura power is faint rather than moderate). You also gain a +2 bonus on Bluff checks to send secret messages."
