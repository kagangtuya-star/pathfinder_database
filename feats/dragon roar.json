    "prerequisites": "Str 15, Improved Unarmed Strike, Dragon Style, Stunning Fist, Acrobatics 8 ranks",
    "benefit": "You gain one additional Stunning Fist attempt per day. While using Dragon Style, as a standard action you can expend two Stunning Fist attempts to unleash a concussive roar in a 15-foot cone. Creatures caught in the cone take your unarmed strike damage and become shaken for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from being shaken.",
    "special": "If you have the Elemental Fist feat (<i>Advanced Playerâ€™s Guide <\/i>158), you can expend a daily use of that feat to deal your Elemental Fist damage to those caught in the cone. This damage is not halved even on a save.",

    "staminaText": "Instead of spending two uses of Stunning Fist to unleash a concussive roar, you can spend one use of Stunning Fist and 5 stamina points to do so.",
