    "description": "Your faith not only heals the body, it tugs the strands of fate.",
    "prerequisites": "Channel positive energy 3d6, worshiper of Pharasma.",
    "benefit": "When you channel positive energy to heal living creatures, you grant each creature you heal the ability to roll twice and take the better result on a single attack roll, skill check, or saving throw of their choice within a number of rounds equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum 1). Multiple uses of this ability do not stack, but they do reset the effectâ€™s duration. A creature can only benefit from one instance of this channel effect at a time."
