    "benefit": "Each time you make a full attack wielding a pair of daggers or a pair of kama and hit a creature with both weapons, you reduce its armor bonus to AC by 1 until the beginning of your next turn. This reduction stacks to a minimum armor bonus of +0. For example, if you hit a creature wearing a chain shirt with two primary attacks and two off-hand attacks, you would reduce its armor bonus to AC from +4 to +2.",
