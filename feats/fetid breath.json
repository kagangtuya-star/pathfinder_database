Creatures in the area must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Constitution modifier) or they are nauseated for 1d6 minutes. Affected creatures that spend a full-round action gasping for fresh air and scraping off your oral debris may attempt another save to overcome the effect.
