    "description": "You seek new applications for magical energy.",
    "prerequisites": "You must have created a new spell, or have The Way Things Work background.",
    "benefit": "When casting a spell youâ€™ve created, add 1 to your caster level. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in Spellcraft, this bonus increases to +4.",
    "special": "For a self-created spell to benefit from this feat, it must be a truly novel spell. Spells slightly altered from the original (for example, <i>delayed blast fireball<\/i> as compared to <i>fireball<\/i>) gain no benefit. Alchemists can benefit from this feat as though their formulae and extracts were spells."
