    "description": "You use powerful, deadly bursts of speed to charge and attack an additional foe.",
    "prerequisites": "Wis 13, Barracuda Slam, Barracuda Style, Improved Unarmed Strike, Acrobatics 7 ranks, Swim 7 ranks.",
    "benefit": "You gain a swim speed equal to your base speed. When you attack on a charge in water or on land and the attack hits, you can immediately make a second charge attack against a second opponent. All the normal requirements for making a charge, such as moving at least 10 feet and moving in a straight line, apply to this second attack. The total distance of the two charge attacks cannot exceed the normal maximum distance for a charge (usually double your speed).<br><br> The movement, including leaving the first targetâ€™s threatened area, provokes attacks of opportunity as normally. You cannot use pounce or other abilities that grant extra attacks on your turn if you use Barracuda Dash to make a second attack.",
