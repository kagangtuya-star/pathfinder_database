    "description": "You may aim your thrown axe to avoid an enemy’s shield and even trip your opponent.",
    "prerequisites": "Dex 13, base attack bonus +1",
    "benefit": "You can choose to take a –2 penalty on a ranged attack roll with an axe, bouncing it or sliding it along the ground. If the target is flat-footed, running, or charging, this attack ignores any bonuses to the target’s AC from its shield. If the attack hits, you may immediately make a trip attempt against the target as a free action. If you fail to trip your opponent, your opponent does not get an attempt to trip you in return."
