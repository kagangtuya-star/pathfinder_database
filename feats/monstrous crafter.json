    "benefit": "Whenever you use the Grisly Ornament feat, you are able to permanently integrate one ornament you have crafted using the harvested creature parts into a wondrous item. The ornament grants no ongoing benefits, but once per day you can activate an integrated ornament as a free action to gain its full benefits for 1 minute. You can integrate an ornament into a wondrous item (or replace an item’s existing ornament) by spending 8 hours of work and 100 gp × the creature’s CR.",
