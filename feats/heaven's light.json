    "description": "You are a luminous beacon in the darkness, an icon of order and kindness through which the light of Heaven itself can shine, even in the most dreadful of realms.",
    "prerequisites": "Knowledge (planes) 1 rank",
    "benefit": "As a standard action, you can emit an aura of bright light centered on a glowing halo above or behind your head. The illumination provided is equal in intensity to that of a torch. If you have at least 5 ranks in Knowledge (planes) the illumination is equivalent to that created by a <i>daylight<\/i> spell. If you have at least 15 ranks in Knowledge (planes), the light becomes further infused with Heavenly power, and each evil creature within 30 feet of you must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your level + your Charisma modifier) or become sickened by the light for as long as it remains in range plus 1 additional round after leaving the area."
