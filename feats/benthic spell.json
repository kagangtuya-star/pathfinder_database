    "text": "Explorers in the depths of the Arcadian Ocean have learned that deadly pressure can be just as lethal as any flame.",
    "benefit": "You can modify a spell that deals acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage to deal damage through high-pressure water instead. The spell gains the water descriptor, and you can either replace the spell’s normal damage with bludgeoning damage or split the spell’s damage so that half is bludgeoning and half is of its normal type. Creatures with damage reduction apply their damage reduction to bludgeoning damage from a benthic spell, but the spell counts as bludgeoning and magic for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction.<br><br> A benthic spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell’s actual level."
