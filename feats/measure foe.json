    "benefit": "You can attempt a Sense Motive check as a free action to deduce a foe’s martial training after observing the foe’s movements for at least 1 minute or observing the foe’s attacks for at least 2 rounds. You take a –10 penalty on your check if you are observing movements, rather than attacks. The DC equals 20 + the creature’s base attack bonus or 10 + the creature’s Bluff or Disguise modifier, whichever is higher.",
