    "name": "Object of Legend",
    "url": "https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Object%20of%20Legend",
    "descriptors": ["Story"],
    "source": ["Quests and Campaigns pg. 16"],
    "description": "The object of your quest drives you ever forward.",
    "prerequisites": "You must have some highly personal stake in attaining the object of your quest as determined collectively by you and the GM—such as needing an ancestral weapon to exact your revenge against a known betrayer, seeking to destroy the artifact that caused your family's downfall generations ago, or attempting to behead a monster that ravaged your homeland during your youth.",
    "benefit": "When you gain this feat, select one of the quest objects on this page or the facing page, or devise a quest object with your GM based on the quest objects presented in this section. You gain a +2 bonus on any Knowledge checks to gain information on the object of your quest. If you have 10 or more ranks in the Knowledge skill in question, the bonus increases to +4. In addition, once per day when you threaten a critical hit against a foe who specifically aims to stop you from completing your quest, you gain a +10 bonus on your confirmation roll against that opponent. You must announce the use of this ability after threatening the critical hit and before rolling your confirmation roll. This bonus does not stack with bonuses on confirmation rolls from other feats, such as Critical Focus.",
    "special": "This feat may be taken more than once. Each time it is taken, select a new quest object to strive for. As with all story feats, a character cannot take this feat again until she has completed the goal of the feat’s first iteration."
