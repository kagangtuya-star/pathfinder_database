    "source": ["Wilderness Origins pg. 21"],
    "description": "Many familiars are able to turn into other animals, but a few familiars have greater talents, and can transform into humanoid bodies of their own.",
    "prerequisites": "Familiar class feature, caster level 9th, your familiar must have the change shape universal monster ability.",
    "benefit": "Your familiar’s change shape universal monster ability can function as <i>alter self<\/i>, and it gains a single alternate form of either Small or Medium size. This form is of a child or teenager of its master’s species, and once chosen cannot be changed. Such changeling familiars always bear some kind of visible mark of their original nature, such as a cat’s eyes, a serpent’s tongue, or small demonic horns. The changeling familiar does not gain any new languages with this transformation, so changeling familiars are often mute."
