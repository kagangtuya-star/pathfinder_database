    "description": "Your expertise with entropic resin causes your necromancy spells to strike fear in those they affect.",
    "benefit": "When you cast a necromancy spell using entropic resin as an esoteric material component, one target of that spell becomes shaken. If your spell allows a saving throw and the target succeeds at its save, it is unaffected by this effect. If the spell causes the target to become shaken or frightened, this effect doesn’t increase the severity of that condition (so a spell that frightens a creature wouldn’t instead cause it to become panicked due to this feat). This is a mind-affecting fear effect.<br><br> When you gain entropic resin’s greater component effect with a necromancy spell, treat your caster level as an additional 1 higher for determining the damage dice. (This also increases the spell’s maximum damage dice if applicable.)"
