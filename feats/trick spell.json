    "description": "The vengeful nature of your goddess flows through your magic, turning your enemies against themselves.",
    "prerequisites": "Ability to cast 1st-level spells, chaotic neutral alignment, worshiper of Calistria.",
    "benefit": "Only enchantment spells that affect a single target and can be negated with a successful Will save can be trick spells. If the target fails its Will save against a trick spell, in addition to the spell’s normal effects, the target also clumsily hinders itself. Immediately attempt a special combat maneuver check (1d20 + your caster level + your Charisma bonus) to perform a dirty trick combat maneuver against the target. Any feats you have that apply to dirty trick maneuvers (such as Greater Dirty Trick<sup>APG<\/sup>) also apply to this check. A trick spell takes up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell’s actual level."
