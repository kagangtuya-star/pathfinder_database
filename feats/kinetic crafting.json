    "text": "You can use your wild talents to help you craft magic items.",
    "prerequisites": "Kineticist level 3rd.",
    "benefit": "When crafting a magic item or taking item creation feats, you can treat your kineticist level as your caster level. In addition, you can treat any wild talent you have as a spell of the same level or lower for the purpose of fulfilling the requirements for magic item creation (except spell-completion and spell-trigger items). This wild talent must be associated with the same element or deal the same type of energy damage as the emulated spellâ€™s descriptor."
