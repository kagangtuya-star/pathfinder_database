    "description": "Choose a type of crossbow (hand, light, heavy) or a single type of one-handed or two-handed firearm that you are proficient with. You can reload such a weapon quickly.",
    "prerequisites": "Weapon Proficiency (crossbow type chosen) or Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearm).",
    "benefit": "The time required for you to reload your chosen type of weapon is reduced to a free action (for a hand or light crossbow), a move action (for heavy crossbow or one-handed firearm), or a standard action (two-handed firearm). Reloading a crossbow or firearm still provokes attacks of opportunity. <br><br> If you have selected this feat for a hand crossbow or light crossbow, you may fire that weapon as many times in a full-attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow. ",
    "normal": "A character without this feat needs a move action to reload a hand or light crossbow, a standard action to reload a one-handed firearm, or a full-round action to load a heavy crossbow or a two-handed firearm.",
    "special": "You can gain Rapid Reload multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of crossbow or a new type of firearm.",

    "staminaText": "When reloading a crossbow or firearm, you can spend 5 stamina points to reduce the reload time by one step; a standard action becomes a move action, a move action becomes a swift action, and a swift action becomes a free action. The weapon you are reloading doesn’t need to be the one you chose when you took this feat. If the weapon already has a reload time of one free action, when you make a full attack with the weapon, you can spend 2 stamina points to gain a +1 bonus on all damage rolls with the weapon during that full attack.",

    "mythicBenefit": "You gain the benefits of Rapid Reload with all crossbows and firearms, not just the one you originally chose when you gained that feat. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to gain the ability to reload crossbows and firearms without provoking attacks of opportunity for 1 minute.",
