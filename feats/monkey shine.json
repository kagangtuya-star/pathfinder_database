    "prerequisites": "Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, Monkey Moves, Monkey Style, Stunning Fist, Acrobatics 11 ranks, Climb 11 ranks",
    "benefit": "While using Monkey Style, if you successfully deliver a Stunning Fist attempt, in addition to the normal effect of Stunning Fist, you can spend a free action to enter a square adjacent to you that is within your opponent’s space. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. While you are in your opponent’s space, you gain a +4 dodge bonus to AC and a +4 bonus on melee attack rolls against that opponent. If otherwise unhindered, the opponent can move away from you, but if he does, he provokes an attack of opportunity from you even if his choice of movement does not normally do so.",
    "normal": "You cannot enter an opponent’s space.",
    "staminaSource": ["Pathfinder Unchained pg. 127"],
    "staminaText": "After you have used this feat to enter an opponent’s space, if that opponent moves away from you, you can spend stamina points to move along with the opponent. You must spend 2 stamina points per 5 feet you move. The opponent’s movement doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity from you if you move with the opponent, nor do you provoke attacks of opportunity when moving in this way.",
