    "source": ["Ultimate Campaign pg. 72"],
    "description": "You seek to build a bastion against which your enemies shall break like water against the rocks.",
    "prerequisites": "You must have the Leadership feat and must lead at least 10 combat-capable followers (such as fighters or rangers)",
    "benefit": "You can spend a move action to give battle orders to your troops, granting creatures under your command within 60 feet your choice of a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, a +1 dodge bonus to AC, or a +1 bonus on a single type of saving throw. All creatures must receive the same benefit. You canâ€™t use this benefit on allies not under your command. This is a language-dependent, mind-affecting effect."
