    "description": "An inexhaustible arsenal lies in the Shadow Plane, waiting to be unleashed.",
    "prerequisites": "Knowledge (planes) 4 ranks, shadow weapon class feature",
    "benefit": "As a swift action, you can thin the barriers between yourself and the Shadow Plane, allowing you to create shadow weapons more easily. While this effect is active, you can create new shadow weapons as a free action. This does not increase the number of shadow weapons you can maintain at a single time."
