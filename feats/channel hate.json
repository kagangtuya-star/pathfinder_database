Upon obtaining channel energy 9d6, you can affect a number of creatures within 30 feet equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum 2 creatures) with this feat instead. If you expend an extra use of channel energy when using this feat, the target does not gain a second saving throw against this effect if you designate the targetâ€™s friend or loved one as its hated enemy."
