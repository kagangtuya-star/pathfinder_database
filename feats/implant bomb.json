    "source": ["Ultimate Magic pg. 152"],
    "description": "You can attach a bomb to a creature that explodes when the creature dies or after 24 hours.",
    "prerequisites": "Heal 5 ranks, delayed bomb alchemist discovery",
    "benefit": "You may implant a bomb in a willing or helpless creature (a mindless creature under your control, such as a zombie, counts as willing for this purpose). This takes 1 hour and expends 1 use of your bomb ability for the day. When the implanted creature dies or is destroyed, the bomb detonates in the creature’s square as if it were a delayed bomb set by you (though you can set the bomb’s damage to less than your normal bomb damage). You can use any bomb-affecting discoveries on this implanted bomb (acid bomb, frost bomb, smoke bomb, and so on) as normal. The bomb automatically detonates 24 hours after you implant it in the creature."
