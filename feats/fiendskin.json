    "benefit": "You gain defensive abilities related to your patron’s outsider subtype. For example, if your patron is a devil, the abilities listed below tie into the devil subtype (see Creature Subtypes, starting on page 310 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary<\/i>). These benefits tie to your patron’s subtype, not your specific patron (its abilities might differ from the norm)."
