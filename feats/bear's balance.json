    "text": "Your anger is always available below the surface, but can be carefully directed. Those who would force you to lose control encounter an unpleasant surprise.",
    "prerequisites": "Iron Will, rage class feature.",
    "benefit": "You gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks when not raging. When you fail a saving throw against a fear effect, you can choose to enter your rage rather than succumb to fear. You can not voluntarily end your rage until the fear effect expires or is ended in some other way (such as due to the death of the fear-inducing creature) or you exhaust your rounds of rage for the day. This feat has no effect if you are already raging when exposed to a fear effect.",
