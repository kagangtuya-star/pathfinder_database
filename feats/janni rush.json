    "description": "When you leap to the attack, your blows are like bolts from on high.",
    "prerequisites": "Improved Unarmed Strike, Janni Style, Janni Tempest, Acrobatics 8 ranks, Perform (dance) 8 ranks",
    "benefit": "While using Janni Style, you are always considered to have a running start when jumping. Further, if you jump as part of a charge and make an unarmed strike against the designated opponent, a hit allows you to roll the unarmed strikeâ€™s damage dice twice and add the results together before adding modifiers (such as from Strength) or extra dice (such as precision-based damage or dice from weapon abilities). The extra damage dice are not multiplied on a successful critical hit.",
    "staminaSource": ["Pathfinder Unchained pg. 124"],
    "staminaText": "You can spend 5 stamina points to multiply the extra damage dice from this feat on a critical hit.",
