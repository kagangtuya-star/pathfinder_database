    "description": "Creatures harmed by your spells relive their torments in nightly terrors.",
    "benefit": "A traumatic spell causes lingering memories of pain and suffering in creatures harmed by it. When a creature fails a saving throw against a traumatic spell, the next time it sleeps it must succeed at a Will save with a DC equal to the original spell’s DC or be affected as if by <i>nightmare<\/i>. Each time the target fails its save, it must save again the following night or be affected by another <i>nightmare<\/i>, though the save DC decreases by 2 each night after the first. This metamagic feat can be applied only to spells with the emotion or fear descriptor. A traumatic spell uses up a spell slot 2 levels higher than the spell’s actual level."
