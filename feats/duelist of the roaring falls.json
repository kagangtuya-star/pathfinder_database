    "description": "You have embraced the Roaring Falls method of Aldori swordplay, known for its elegant, sweeping strikes.",
    "prerequisites": "Aldori Dueling Disciple, Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Aldori dueling sword), Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus (Aldori dueling sword), base attack bonus +5.",
    "benefit": "When you use an Aldori dueling sword to deal damage to a shaken, frightened, or panicked foe, you can add your Dexterity bonus to damage rolls instead of your Strength bonus. If you can already add your Dexterity bonus to damage rolls, you instead gain a +1 competence bonus on damage rolls made with an Aldori dueling sword. When you attempt a dueling parry during a duel, the penalty on your attack roll to parry is reduced from –5 to –3. To gain these benefits, you must be wielding only an Aldori dueling sword (not using a shield, an off-hand weapon, armor spikes, unarmed strikes, or natural weapons).",
