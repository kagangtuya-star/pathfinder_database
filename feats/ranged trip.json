    "benefit": "As a full-round action, you can attempt to perform a trip combat maneuver with any ranged weapon at a –2 penalty. Add your Dexterity modifier to your CMB in place of your Strength modifier and apply range penalties to your combat maneuver check, doubling the penalties from range increments. If your target is more than 30 feet away, you take an additional –2 penalty. If the trip attempt is successful, the target also takes damage as if you had made a successful attack with that weapon. You can’t be knocked prone by failing the trip attempt.",
