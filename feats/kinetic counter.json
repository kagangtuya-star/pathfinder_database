    "description": "You can use your kinetic blast to counter your enemy’s opposing elemental abilities.",
    "prerequisites": "Cold simple blast, fire simple blast, or water simple blast; kinetic blast class feature",
    "benefit": "You can ready an action to use your blast to counter an opponent’s elemental abilities. If you ready a fire simple blast, you can counter any spell or activated extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like ability that has the water or ice descriptor, and if you ready a cold or water simple blast, you can counter any spell or activated extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like ability that has the fire descriptor. In order to successfully counter the effect, you must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to either 11 + the opponent’s caster level (for spells and spell-like abilities) or 11 + the opponent’s Hit Dice (for extraordinary and supernatural abilities). Against spells and spell-like abilities, treat a success as if you had counterspelled the effect using <i>dispel magic<\/i>. Against activated supernatural and extraordinary abilities, a successful kinetic counter negates the ability’s effect entirely while still expending the ability. For example, if a pyrokineticist succeeds at her caster level check against a white dragon’s breath weapon, she negates the breath weapon’s effect in the entire area, and the dragon must wait 1d4 rounds to use its breath weapon again."
