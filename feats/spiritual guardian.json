    "description": "Your spiritual guardians are more powerful than those of most others.",
    "prerequisites": "Ability to cast <i>spiritual weapon<\/i> or <i>spiritual ally<\/i>, spirit magic class feature.",
    "benefit": "Whenever you cast <i>spiritual weapon<\/i>, spiritual ally, or a similar spell that grants you a spiritual guardian, that guardian uses your shaman level instead of your base attack bonus to determine its base attack bonus, potentially granting it multiple attacks. Additionally, it gains a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance as well as on damage rolls."
