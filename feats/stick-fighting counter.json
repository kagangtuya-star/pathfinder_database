    "description": "Using stick-fighting techniques both defensively and offensively, you can turn your parries into counterattacks.",
    "prerequisites": "Stick-Fighting Style, base attack bonus +4.",
    "benefit": "While you are fighting defensively, as a free action you can select an opponent you have attacked on that turn and prepare yourself to counter one of its attacks. Once per round, when that opponent attempts a melee attack against you and the attack misses, the attacker provokes an attack of opportunity from you, provided that it is within your threatened area. You must use a club, quarterstaff, dan bong, sap, or tonfa to perform the attack of opportunity.",
