    "prerequisites": "Ranged legerdemain class feature",
    "benefit": "Whenever you deal sneak attack damage, you fluster your foe, causing your target to take a penalty on Will saves equal to the number of sneak attack dice you rolled on the attack for 1 round. This penalty does not stack with itself, but each time you deal sneak attack damage to an affected target, the duration is extended by 1 round."
