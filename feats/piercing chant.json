    "description": "Music plays a key role in goblin culture—at the very least, goblins are fond of cacophonous chants describing the last enemy they slew or what they’re roasting for dinner. You have gathered, however, that non-goblins don’t appreciate your songs very much.",
    "prerequisites": "Goblin.",
    "benefit": "As a full-round action, you can sing a song so terrible and ear-splitting that each enemy within 15 feet of you that hears it must succeed at a Will save or be dazed for 1 round. The DC of this saving throw is equal to 10 + half your level + your Charisma modifier. Whether or not the initial save is successful, a creature cannot be affected by this ability again for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect."
