    "description": "You can cast your spells underwater or into water with little difficulty.",
    "benefit": "An aquatic spell functions normally underwater and requires no caster level check to cast, even if it has the fire descriptor. In addition, the spell can be cast from the surface into water and still be effective. An aquatic spell uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spellâ€™s actual level."
