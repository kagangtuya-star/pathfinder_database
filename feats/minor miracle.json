    "description": "You can call upon your deity for a minor miracle.",
    "prerequisites": "Wis 12, Knowledge (religion) 5 ranks, alignment must match that of your worshiped deity.",
    "benefit": "Choose two domains associated with your deity (if you have access to one or more domains already, the chosen domains can be the same ones you already have access to, or different ones). Once per day, by presenting a holy symbol of your deity and calling out in supplication, you can cast the 1st-level spell associated with either of the two chosen domains as a spell-like ability. You choose which domainâ€™s spell you cast at the time you use the ability. Your caster level for this effect is equal to your total Hit Dice, and the saving throw DC, if any, is Charisma-based."
