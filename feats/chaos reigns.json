    "text": "The Abyss dreams of devastation; the slightest taste of its power is an incitement to bare-fisted violence.",
    "prerequisites": "Knowledge (planes) 3 ranks.",
    "benefit": "As a swift action, you can allow Abyssal wrath to overtake you. While in this state, you can use one of your hands as a slam natural attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (or 1d4 for Small creatures). A creature that does not have hands can instead use a different part of its body to make this slam attack.<br><br> You can use this featâ€™s benefit for a number of minutes per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes). These minutes need not be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments."
