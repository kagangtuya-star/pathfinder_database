    "description": "Your cold spells render their targets sluggish.",
    "benefit": "Whenever you cast a spell with the cold descriptor, you can take a –1 penalty on attack rolls made with the spell and reduce the spell saving throw’s DC by 1 to cause any target that is dealt cold damage by the spell to have its movement speed reduced by 5 feet and become unable to take 5-foot steps. This effect lasts for 1 round + 1 round per 3 spell levels of the spell. You must choose to use this feat before making an attack roll or before your targets attempt their saving throws. This feat has no effect on spells that neither allow a saving throw nor require an attack roll."
