    "benefit": "As an immediate action when you fail a saving throw against an emotion, fear, or pain effect, you can ignore the effect and instead become dazed for an amount of time equal to twice the duration of the original effect. Any nonlethal damage you would have taken from the original effect is reduced to its minimum value (as though a 1 had been rolled on all dice). You cannot activate this ability if you are currently dazed.<br><br> You can use this featâ€™s benefit once per day, plus an additional time per day for every 5 ranks you have in Knowledge (planes)."
