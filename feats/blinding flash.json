    "description": "You can temporarily blind your opponent by using your weapon or shield to flash sunlight into its eyes.",
    "prerequisites": "Dex 13, Combat Expertise",
    "benefit": "As a move action, you can expertly angle the blade of your weapon or shield to reflect light into an opponentâ€™s eyes, dazzling your foe for 1 round. This feat functions as a gaze attack, and the target must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Dex modifier) to resist the effect. This is a sight-dependent effect, and does not work on creatures that are already blinded or creatures that do not rely on sight as their primary sense. You must be wielding a weapon or shield with a polished or reflective surface in order to use this feat. You must be in an area of bright light to use this feat.",
