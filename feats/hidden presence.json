    "description": "You are adept at hiding within your host.",
    "prerequisites": "Int or Cha 17, ability to cast <i>possession<\/i> or <i>greater possession<\/i>",
    "benefit": "While possessing another creature, you can hide yourself from divinations and pass through wards such as <i>magic circle against evil<\/i> or the effects of a <i>forbiddance<\/i> spell. You must attempt a Will save against the spell (even if it doesn’t normally allow a saving throw). If you succeed, the spell treats you as if you were your host (for instance, divinations would reveal only the host’s alignment, and <i>forbiddance<\/i> keyed to the host’s alignment wouldn’t damage you). If your saving throw fails, the spell functions against you as normal; if the spell normally allows a save, your previous failure doesn’t count as a failed save against the spell’s normal effects."
