    "benefit": "When you perform a drag<sup>APG<\/sup> combat maneuver with your whip, you can choose not to move with your target, instead bringing your target closer to you. If you do this, you can’t drag the target any farther than the distance it takes to move it adjacent to you, even if your result was high enough to drag the target farther. You gain a +2 bonus on drag combat maneuver checks when using a whip to drag, but this bonus doesn’t stack with the bonus from Improved Drag.",
