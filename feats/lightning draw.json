Drawing these weapons does not take an action. <br><br>If you have the instant unveil deed, it doesn’t cost any panache to use the ability described in the previous paragraph as long as you have at least 1 point of panache, and you can spend 1 panache point to draw a single light or one-handed piercing weapon, hidden or not, as an immediate action whenever a creature attacks you.",
