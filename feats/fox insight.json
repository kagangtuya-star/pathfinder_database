    "benefit": "While using Fox Style, you can use your base attack bonus in place of your ranks in Sense Motive to determine your Sense Motive skill bonus when foes attempt to feint against you, and creatures attempting to demoralize you don’t gain a bonus for being bigger than you (though they still take a penalty for being smaller). If your Intelligence score is at least 19, the DC to demoralize or feint you increases by 4.",
