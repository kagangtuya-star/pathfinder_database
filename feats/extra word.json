    "benefit": "Add one effect word from your class’s word list to your list of words known. This is in addition to the number of words normally gained at each level in your class. You may instead add two words from your class’s word list to your list of words known, but both of these words must be at least one level lower than the highest-level wordspell you can cast in that class. Once made, these choices cannot be changed.",
    "special": "You can only take this feat if you possess levels in a class whose spellcasting relies on a limited list of words known, such as the bard, oracle, or sorcerer. You can take this feat multiple times."
