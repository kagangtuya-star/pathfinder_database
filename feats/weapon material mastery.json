Additionally, the duration of this effect increases by 1 round for every 5 points of the appropriate type of energy damage to which the weapon is exposed beyond 10.<br><br> <i>Greenwood<\/i><sup>UE<\/sup> <i>or Living Steel<\/i><sup>UE<\/sup>: When you score a critical hit, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your base attack bonus + your Strength modifier) or lose its fast healing and regeneration (if any) for 1d3 rounds.<br><br> <i>Viridium<\/i><sup>UE<\/sup>: You add your Strength modifier and the weapon's enhancement bonus (if any) to the Fortitude DC to determine if a foe struck by the weapon contracts leprosy.<br><br> <i>Whipwood<\/i><sup>UE<\/sup>: The weapon gains the trip special weapon feature, and you gain a +2 bonus on trip combat maneuvers made with it.<br><br> <i>Wyroot<\/i><sup>UE<\/sup>: Once per turn, you can absorb life points from the weapon as a free action instead of a swift action. You can never absorb life points from wyroot weapons or equipment more than once per turn."
