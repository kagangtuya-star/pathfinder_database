    "description": "When you’re dealing with large and secretive organizations, a dead enemy is just a corpse, but a captured enemy can be a tool.",
    "prerequisites": "Base attack bonus +3.",
    "benefit": "If you deal an amount of damage to a creature that would slay it outright, you can pull that attack, instead dealing only enough damage to reduce its hit points to –1, and leave it stable."
