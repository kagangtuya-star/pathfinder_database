    "prerequisites": "Catch Off-Guard or Throw Anything, base attack bonus +1.",
    "benefit": "As a free action, you can pick up an unattended item as part of a movement. Picking up the item does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If you have Throw Anything, you can pick up a number of closely gathered items that could be held in one hand (such as dishes from a stack of plates) equal to your Dexterity modifier (minimum 1). You must have a hand free to use this feat.",
