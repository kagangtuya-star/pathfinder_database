    "description": "When primal magic surrounds you, you can channel it to transform the nature of your kinetic blasts.",
    "prerequisites": "Kineticist level 1st",
    "benefit": "When using a simple kinetic blast in an area where primal magic is either predominant or very common, you can accept 1 point of burn to cause your blast to become one of the following simple blasts instead. Roll 1d10 to determine the simple blast: 1 = air, 2 = cold, 3 = earth, 4 = electric, 5 = fire, 6 = gravity, 7 = negative, 8 = telekinetic, 9 = water, 10 = wood. You can apply any of your form or substance infusions that are allowed as choices for the random blast, accepting the typical burn cost."
