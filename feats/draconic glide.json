    "source": ["Advanced Race Guide pg. 136"],
    "description": "You possess draconic defenses and wings that allow you to glide.",

    "benefit": "You gain a +2 bonus against sleep and paralysis effects. You grow a pair of wings that you can use to fall and glide at a safe pace. You can make a DC 15 Fly check to fall safely from any height without taking falling damage, as if using feather fall. When falling safely, you may make an additional DC 15 Fly check to glide, moving 5 feet laterally for every 20 feet you fall.",
    "special": "If you have the gliding wings racial trait, you don't need to make a Fly check to glide, and you can move 10 feet laterally for every 20 feet you fall.",
