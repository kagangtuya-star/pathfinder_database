    "name": "Crisis of Conscience",
    "url": "https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Crisis%20of%20Conscience",
    "descriptors": ["Story"],
    "source": ["Champions of Balance pg. 5"],
    "description": "Your internal struggle and contradictory actions have left you teetering on a knife’s edge between good and evil. You must choose which path you will make your own.",
    "prerequisites": "Lawful neutral, neutral, or chaotic neutral alignment. Your alignment must have shifted from either good or evil at least once since 1st level or the last time you completed this feat (see Special)",
    "benefit": "You are an enigma unto those who cleave to notions of morality as guiding life principles. Habits and mannerisms from your past life send subtly confusing signals to those trying to read you. Whenever another character attempts to discern your alignment, loyalties, or intentions (including via magical effects such as <i>detect thoughts <\/i>and when you are using Bluff to send a secret message or feint), you gain a +2 bonus on opposed skill checks and on Will saving throws to resist such effects.",
    "special": "If you’ve already completed this feat by changing to the opposite moral alignment and have since returned to being morally neutral, you may take this feat a second time. You gain no additional basic benefits, but if you complete this feat’s goal a second time by crossing back to your original alignment, you gain additional completion benefits—you gain the second completion benefit, and can apply the first benefit against good and evil creatures."
