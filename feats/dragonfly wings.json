    "prerequisites": "Dex 15, Wis 15, Dragonfly Style, Improved Unarmed Strike, Acrobatics 5 ranks, Climb 5 ranks.",
    "benefit": "While using Dragonfly Style, the bonus on your melee attacks increases to +2 and applies to opponents up to two size categories larger than you. In addition, you can substitute a creature your size or larger in place of a vertical surface. You can freely use a willing creature in such a manner, but using a hostile creature requires a successful Acrobatics check with a DC equal to the creatureâ€™s CMD. If you fail this check by 5 or more, you provoke an attack of opportunity from the hostile creature.",
