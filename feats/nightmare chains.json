    "source": ["Book of the Damned pg. 179"],
    "description": "Chains are a kyton’s inheritance and dominion.",
    "prerequisites": "Kyton subtype, 5 or more Hit Dice",
    "benefit": "You gain the kyton’s dancing chains ability (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary<\/i> 185), except you can control only up to two chains this way. This grants you two chain attacks, which deal damage as per a spiked chain made for a creature of your size. If you already have the dancing chains ability, you can control two additional chains.",
    "special": "At the GM’s discretion, non-kyton outsiders can select this feat if they have a thematic link to chains (such as horned devils or demonic servants of Shivaska)."
