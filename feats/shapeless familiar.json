    "prerequisites": "Familiar class feature, caster level 7th",
    "benefit": "Your familiar gains the change shape universal monster ability. This ability functions as <i>beast shape II<\/i> and grants access to a single alternate form, which must be the same size as the familiar. Once chosen, this form cannot be changed.",
    "special": "You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take this feat, your familiar gains an additional alternate form. If taken by a familiar that already has the change shape universal monster ability (like an imp), this grants a single additional form."
