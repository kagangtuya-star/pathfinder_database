Your penalties from two-weapon fighting increase by 2 on all attack rolls you make when doing so, and you can’t decrease the penalties to less than –2 even if other abilities would reduce the penalties further.

If you attack without using your off-hand weapon, you can use the aforementioned feats despite your other hand being occupied.",
