    "description": "You implant a flexible mesmerist trick in the target, triggering the more beneficial trick when the time is right.",
    "prerequisites": "Any two trick feats",
    "benefit": "You can implant a contingent trick in a target’s mind, following the same rules and limitations for implanting mesmerist tricks. A contingent trick acts as a mesmerist trick in all ways, except that when you are implanting a contingent trick, you choose any two mesmerist tricks you know (including masterful tricks) and implant both in your target. You can’t choose the same trick twice. When you trigger a contingent trick, it acts only as the mesmerist trick that corresponds to the condition you used to trigger the trick."
