    "description": "Though not a swashbuckler, you have and can use panache.",
    "prerequisites": "No levels in a class that has the panache class feature",
    "benefit": "You gain a small amount of panache and the ability to perform a single 1st-level swashbuckler deed. Choose a 1st-level deed from the swashbucklerâ€™s deeds class feature (see page 56; you can't select opportune parry and riposte). Once chosen, this deed cannot be changed.",
    "special": "If you gain levels in a class that has the panache class feature, you can immediately trade this feat for the Extra Panache feat.",
    "staminaSource": ["Pathfinder Unchained pg. 113"],
    "staminaText": "Choose a second 1st-level swashbuckler deed. You can spend panache<sup>ACG<\/sup> to use this deed, or you can spend 5 stamina points to use either of your deeds in place of panache. If you gain levels in a class that grants the panache class feature, you retain the ability to spend 5 stamina points in place of panache when using any of your 1st-level deeds, and this becomes a combat trick of the Extra Panache<sup>ACG<\/sup> feat (even though that feat is not a combat feat)."
