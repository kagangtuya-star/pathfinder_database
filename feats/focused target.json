    "text": "You pour your entire focus into slaying your chosen target.",
    "prerequisites": "Studied target class feature (second studied target).",
    "benefit": "When you study a target, you can reduce the number of additional targets you can maintain as a studied target. For each target reduced in this way, you increase your studied target bonus by 1 for either attack rolls, damage rolls, skill checks, or the DCs of your abilities. Each such increase must be applied to a different category (attack rolls, damage rolls, skill checks, or DCs). You can end the effects of this feat as a free action."
