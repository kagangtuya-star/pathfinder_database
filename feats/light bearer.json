    "url": "https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Light%20Bearer",
    "source": ["Ultimate Intrigue pg. 134"],
    "description": "You recruit a torchbearer who joins you on your adventures to help illuminate even the darkest dungeons.",
    "prerequisites": "Character level 4th",
    "benefit": "This feat is similar to the Leadership feat, with several exceptions. You can attract only a 1st-level cohort (referred to hereafter as a light bearer) with this feat, and canâ€™t recruit followers. You determine your Leadership score according to the rules presented in the Leadership feat, but your light bearer is always at least 3 levels lower than your level. A light bearer can take levels in alchemist, fighter, or rogue. The light bearer cannot multiclass, though he can take any archetype for which he qualifies."
