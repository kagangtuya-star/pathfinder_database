    "prerequisites": "Cerberus Style, base attack bonus +9 or monk level 9th",
    "benefit": "Whenever you damage an opponent with Cerberus Style, that opponent cannot take 5-foot steps until the beginning of your next turn. Additionally, it is barred from dimensional travel. This effect functions as <i>dimensional anchor<\/i>, except that its duration is 1 round. Spell resistance applies; for the purpose of checks to overcome spell resistance, your caster level is equal to your character level.",
