    "benefit": "When using this style, you can attempt a Sense Motive check (DC = 15 + CR of target) as a move action against a creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher. If you succeed, you gain a +1 dodge bonus to your AC against attacks from the target creature until you are no longer using this style. You can have this bonus against only one creature at a time: if you succeed at this Sense Motive check against another creature, you lose the bonus against the first creature. This bonus increases to +2 when you have 8 ranks in Sense Motive, and to +3 when you have 13 ranks in Sense Motive.",
