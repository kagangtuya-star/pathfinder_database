    "prerequisites": "Channel negative energy 7d6, worshiper of Nethys.",
    "benefit": "Once per day when you channel negative energy to deal damage to living creatures, you can cause affected creatures to make Fortitude saves instead of Will saves. Affected creatures take the amount of damage channeled in force damage (a successful save halves). Creatures that fail their saves are also knocked prone."
