    "source": ["Magic Tactics Toolbox pg. 30"],
    "description": "You can use certain magic items to fuel your innate powers.",
    "prerequisites": "Use Magic Device 6 ranks, base Fortitude saving throw bonus +3.",
    "benefit": "You can focus on an item associated with your race to use a racial spell-like ability that you have without expending any uses per day from that spell-like ability. A racial spell-like ability is any spell-like ability that you have gained from a racial trait, from a feat or trait that lists your race as a prerequisite, or from a class option or archetype that is available only to members of your race. You must use an item with a spell in its construction requirement that belongs to the same school and is at least of the same level as the spell-like ability that you wish to use. You can use this feat once per day, plus an additional time per day when your base Fortitude save bonus reaches +9 and +12."
