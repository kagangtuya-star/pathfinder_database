    "benefit": "While using Djinni Style, as a standard action you can spend two Elemental Fist (<i>Advanced Playerâ€™s Guide <\/i>158) attempts to surround yourself with a whirlwind of electrified air. Creatures adjacent to you take your unarmed strike damage plus the electricity damage from your Elemental Fist and are deafened for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from being deafened.",
