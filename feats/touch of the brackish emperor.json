    "text": "Your touch can suppress spells that aid in breathing water.",
    "prerequisites": "Character level 5th, worshiper of Kelizandri, ",
    "benefit": "Once per day while underwater, you can touch a creature in order to suppress any spells that allow the creature to breathe underwater (<i>air bubble<sup>UC<\/sup><\/i>, <i>life bubble<\/i>, <i>water breathing<\/i>, and so on) for 5 minutes. Suppressing the spells requires you to roll 1d20 + your character level; the DC for each spell is 11 + the spellâ€™s caster level (if the spells affecting the creature have differing caster levels, you might dispel some but not the others). This is a spell-like ability. At 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you can use this touch an additional time each day."
