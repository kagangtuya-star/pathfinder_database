    "benefit": "You can expend a use of lay on hands as a standard action to launch a blast of flame from your weapon. This acts as the kineticist’s fire blast (<i>Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures<\/i> 15), with an effective kineticist level equal to your paladin level – 4. You do not need a free hand to use this ability, but you must be wielding a manufactured melee weapon. You use your Charisma modifier instead of your Constitution modifier to determine the blast’s damage. This blast cannot be modified by infusions or other effects that specifically improve a kineticist’s blast, even if you have them from other classes."
