    "benefit": "You gain a secondary stamina pool with a number of stamina points equal to your Constitution modifier. You can spend these secondary stamina points only when you have 0 stamina points in your primary stamina pool or when you are fatigued, even though you normally can’t spend stamina points while fatigued. You can spend these secondary stamina points as normal, but if the secondary pool drops to 0 points, you become exhausted until you have at least 1 stamina point in your primary pool. Even if you have points in your secondary pool, you are still fatigued as long as you have 0 points in your primary pool. Your secondary pool refreshes only after a full night’s rest.",
