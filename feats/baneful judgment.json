    "text": "You dole out judgment to a particular foe.",
    "prerequisites": "Bane class feature, judgment class feature, monster lore class feature.",
    "benefit": "You can declare a specialized judgment against a creature as a swift action. When pronouncing this judgment, you attempt a Knowledge check to identify the creature, or refer to your previous result if youâ€™ve already identified the creature. If you succeed at the check or have already identified the creature, you can spend 1 round of bane and choose one judgment other than the healing judgment. You gain the benefits of this judgment against that creature for only 1 round plus 1 additional round for every 5 by which you exceeded the DC to identify the target. Subsequent uses of this judgment do not stack with this ability. A creature cannot be the target of this ability again for 24 hours."
