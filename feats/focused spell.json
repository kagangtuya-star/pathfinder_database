    "description": "When you cast a spell that affects more than one creature, one opponent finds it more difficult to resist. ",
    "benefit": "When casting a spell that affects or targets more than one creature, you can choose one target or creature within the spell effect. That creatureâ€™s saving throw DC to resist the spell is increased by +2. You must choose which target to focus the spell on before casting the spell. A focused spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level."
