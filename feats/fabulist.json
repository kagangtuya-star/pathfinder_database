    "descriptors": ["Grit"],
    "source": ["Champions of Balance pg. 19"],
    "description": "You enjoy telling tall tales and gain confidence when others believe them.",
    "prerequisites": "Amateur Gunslinger feat or grit class feature.",
    "benefit": "You gain a +1 bonus on Perform (act, comedy, oratory, and sing) skill checks, and Perform is a class skill for you. In addition, each time you make a successful Bluff check to convince someone of a far-fetched or impossible story, you regain 1 grit point. Successfully lying to a friendly or helpful creature, or a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half your character level, doesnâ€™t restore grit."
