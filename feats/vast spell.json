    "description": "Your spells cover targets across a larger area.",
    "prerequisites": "Caster level 3rd",
    "benefit": "You can alter a spell that targets a number of creatures no more than 30 feet apart, such as haste. The maximum distance apart of those you target with the spell increases to 60 feet. A vast spell uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spellâ€™s actual level."
