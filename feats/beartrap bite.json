    "description": "You can hold your foes even if you do not manage to grapple them.",
    "prerequisites": "Weapon Focus (bite), base attack bonus +6.",
    "benefit": "Whenever you confirm a critical hit against a foe with your bite attack, if your confirmation roll matches or exceeds your foeâ€™s CMD, you can clamp down on your foe to prevent it from moving away as a free action. The foe cannot move outside the area threatened by your bite attack unless it breaks free of your bite. It can attempt to free itself with a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check as if you were grappling it, but neither of you gains the grappled condition. You cannot use your bite attack while you maintain your grip on your foe, but you can release the bite as a swift action to end the effect.",
