    "text": "You can make powerful attacks that place more of your weapon’s poison into a target’s wounds.",
    "prerequisites": "Power Attack; Craft (poison) 3 ranks or poison use class feature.",
    "benefit": "When you damage an opponent with a Power Attack while using a poisoned weapon, you can forgo the bonus damage from Power Attack to increase the save DC of the poison by 1. When your base attack bonus reaches +4, and every +4 thereafter, the bonus to the poison’s save DC increases by an additional 1. This can’t cause the save DC to exceed 15 + 1/2 your character level.",
