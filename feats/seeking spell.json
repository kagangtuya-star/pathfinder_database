    "text": "You can cast spells that bend around barriers to reach their intended destination.",
    "benefit": "A seeking spell’s range can bend around obstacles to reach the intended target. You can define the route yourself or unambiguously identify a target and allow the spell to determine its own path. However, the spell fails if it would have to travel farther than its maximum range to reach the identified target. A ranged attack roll made to deliver a seeking spell is not subject to cover or concealment. In order to benefit from this feat, the selected spell must have a range greater than touch and target one or more creatures, or it must require the caster to make a ranged touch attack. A seeking spell uses up a spell slot 2 levels higher than the spell’s actual level."
