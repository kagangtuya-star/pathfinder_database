    "source": ["Pathfinder Campaign Setting pg. 85"],
    "description": "As a student trained in the Impossible Techniques of Jalmeray, you can rend wood, burst brick, or even shatter steel with the perfect focus and application of your <i>ki<\/i>.",
    "prerequisites": "Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +6, must be lawful",
    "benefit": "You gain a pool of <i>ki<\/i> points equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). As a swift action, you may focus your <i>ki<\/i> into strikes that can overcome the hardness of any substance. Each unarmed strike attack you make while in this focus expends 1 <i>ki<\/i> from your pool, whether or not it hit. You lose your focus automatically when you run out of <i>ki<\/i>, when the encounter ends, if you are reduced to fewer than 0 hit points or killed, or as a free action any time you wish.",
    "special": "You may gain this feat multiple times. For each additional time you gain the feat you add 1 to your ki pool and your unarmed strikes gain an additional property for overcoming damage reduction, in the following order: adamantine, cold iron, silver, magic, lawful, epic. If your unarmed strikes already count as one or more of those properties (from any source), they gain the next property in line.",
