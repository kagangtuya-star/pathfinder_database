    "prerequisites": "Psychic Sensitivity or ability to cast psychic spells, Perception 1 rank or Sense Motive 1 rank",
    "benefit": "You can use either Perception or Sense Motive when reading an emotion aura with the read aura occult skill unlock. Reading a creature’s emotion aura takes you only a full-round action instead of 10 minutes, and if you succeed at your check, you also determine whether that creature is currently affected by a fear or mind-affecting effect and the relative strength of that effect (minor, moderate, strong, as defined in <i>detect magic<\/i>). You don’t learn the source of the effect or the actual effect.",
