    "description": "You track the dealings of criminals with an expert eye.",
    "prerequisites": "Diplomacy 1 rank, Knowledge (local) 1 rank",
    "benefit": "You roll twice and take the better result on Diplomacy checks to access black markets or learn about anyone who has contact with black markets. You can roll twice and take the better result on Knowledge (local) checks to recall information about black markets, criminals, and people directly connected to either. You can search for people trying to disappear in a community, attempting a Diplomacy check to track a target rather than a Survival check, but only within an urban environment."
