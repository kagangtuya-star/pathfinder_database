    "description": "You are able to entangle opponents with the coils of your whip.",
    "prerequisites": "Weapon Focus (whip), Whip Mastery, base attack bonus +5",
    "benefit": "While wielding a whip, you threaten the area of your natural reach plus 5 feet. You can also use a whip to grasp an unattended Small or Tiny object within your whip’s reach and pull that object into your square. To do so, you must hit AC 10 with a melee touch attack. Further, you can use the whip to grasp onto an object within your whip’s reach, using 5 feet of your whip as if it were a grappling hook, allowing you to use the rest of your whip to swing on like a rope. As a free action, you can release the object your whip is grasping, but you cannot use the whip to attack while the whip is grasping an object.",

    "staminaText": "At the start of your turn, you can spend 5 stamina points to increase the radius of the area you threaten while wielding a whip by an additional 5 feet until you make an attack against an opponent in the expanded reach or the beginning of your next turn, whichever comes first.",
