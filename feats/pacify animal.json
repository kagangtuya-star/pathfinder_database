    "source": ["Monster Hunter's Handbook pg. 9"],
    "description": "You are able to calm rampaging animals.",
    "prerequisites": "Wild empathy class feature",
    "benefit": "As a full-round action, you attempt to mollify an animal or magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 and an attitude of hostile toward you or your allies. You attempt a wild empathy check (DC = 10 + the target’s Hit Dice + the target’s Charisma modifier). If you succeed, the target’s attitude toward you and your allies becomes indifferent for 1 minute, and it does not attack during this time. If the target is attacked during this time or if the target can see you or your allies after 1 minute, it becomes hostile again. A creature can be affected by this pacification attempt only once in a 24-hour period.",
    "special": "Animal companions and creatures under magical compulsion are harder to pacify; the DC for such creatures equals 15 + the target’s Hit Dice + the target’s Charisma modifier. An animal companion also applies its bonus on Will saves from the devotion ability to this DC, and attacking the animal’s master also breaks this effect. An animal companion’s master can direct the animal to attack again, but the DC of this Handle Animal check is increased by your wild empathy modifier."
