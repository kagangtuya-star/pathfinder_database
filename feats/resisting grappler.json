    "description": "You are especially adept at fighting off the grabbing appendages of aberrations and other tentacled horrors.",
    "prerequisites": "Dex 13.",
    "benefit": "When a creature hits you with a melee attack and attempts to use the grab ability, it provokes an attack of opportunity from you unless it has the Improved Grapple feat. If you hit the opponent with your attack, treat the damage you deal as 5 higher when calculating the penalty on the attackerâ€™s combat maneuver check to grapple you.",
    "normal": "Creatures using the grab ability does not provoke attacks of opportunity."
