    "description": "Your batter your foes with such disorienting force that they can’t exert their full abilities.",
    "prerequisites": "Dex 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +8.",
    "benefit": "When using this feat, in addition to dealing damage normally, you force a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your character level + your Wisdom modifier). If it fails, it loses its skill ranks and activated feats, such as Power Attack or Stunning Fist, for 1d4 rounds. You must declare you are using this feat before you make your attack roll; if you miss, the target is unaffected and your attempt is wasted. You can try to use Stupefying Strike once per day for every 4 character levels you have, but no more than once per round. Constructs, incorporeal creatures, mindless creatures, plants, undead, and creatures immune to critical hits can’t be affected by this ability.",
