    "description": "Your familiar can rework the dream-stuff it is made of.",
    "prerequisites": "Must have a familiar with the figment archetype (see page 10)",
    "benefit": "Once per day, your familiar can spend a full-round action to manually reshape itself, reassigning 1 evolution point of eidolon evolutions. The evolution it loses canâ€™t be a prerequisite for any other evolutions it has. It can use this ability twice per day at 7th level, and three times per day at 13th level."
