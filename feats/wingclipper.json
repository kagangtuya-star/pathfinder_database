    "description": "Your attacks can prevent winged opponents from flying.",
    "prerequisites": "Base attack bonus +9",
    "benefit": "Whenever you confirm a critical hit against an opponent that uses wings to fly, you can forgo the extra critical damage to instead prevent it from flying for a number of rounds equal to twice the critical multiplier of your attack. Opponents that are flying at the time of the critical effect must succeed at a DC 20 Fly check to avoid taking falling damage."
