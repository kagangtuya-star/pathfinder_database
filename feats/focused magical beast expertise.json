    "prerequisites": "Favored enemy (magical beast) class feature.",
    "benefit": "If a creature makes three or more attacks with natural weapons against you during its turn, you gain partial cover against the third and subsequent natural attacks from that creature. If the creature makes five or more attacks against you with natural weapons, you gain cover (instead of partial cover) against the fifth and subsequent natural attacks. If the attacker is a magical beast, reduce by one the number of natural attacks it must make in order for you to gain cover or partial cover."
