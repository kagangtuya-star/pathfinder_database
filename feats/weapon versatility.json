    "prerequisites": "Weapon Focus, base attack bonus +1",
    "benefit": "When wielding a weapon with which you have Weapon Focus, you can shift your grip as a swift action so that your weapon deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage instead of the damage type normally dealt by that weapon. You may switch back to the weaponâ€™s normal damage type or another damage type as a swift action. If your base attack bonus is +5 or higher, using this feat is a free action instead.",
