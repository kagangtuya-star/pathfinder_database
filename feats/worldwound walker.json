    "description": "Your purity always remains a blessing, even when youâ€™re surrounded by creatures that despise it.",
    "prerequisites": "5 or more Hit Dice, good alignment",
    "benefit": "You can alter the essence of your being to lessen the effects of spells designed to harm good creatures. When affected by spells and effects that behave differently according to alignment (such as <i>unholy word<\/i> or <i>protection from good<\/i>), you can choose whether you are considered good or neutral. This ability does not actually change your alignment or fool divinations, nor does it permit you to overcome alignment requirements for the use of magic items, class abilities, and so on."
