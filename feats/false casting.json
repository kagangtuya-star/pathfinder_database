    "description": "When using a magic item, you can trick onlookers into thinking you used spellcasting instead.",
    "prerequisites": "Magical Aptitude, Bluff 1 rank, Sleight of Hand 1 rank",
    "benefit": "When you use a magic item or a spelllike ability to create a magical effect, you may add additional magic-seeming words and hand gestures to trick onlookers into believing you cast the spell yourself. If using an item that is recognizable as a magical implement (such as a wand or ring), you can trick viewers into thinking you are just using the item as a focus component. Onlookers who have no ranks in Spellcraft have no knowledge of what is genuine spellcasting, and automatically believe you are casting a spell.",
