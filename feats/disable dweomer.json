    "description": "You can disable a magic item, suppressing it for a short time.",
    "prerequisites": "Disable Device 5 ranks, Use Magic Device 5 ranks, trapfinding.",
    "benefit": "You can use Disable Device to suppress the magic of a non-artifact magic item for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the suppression. Using Disable Device in this way takes 2d4 rounds, with a DC of 15 + the itemâ€™s caster level."
