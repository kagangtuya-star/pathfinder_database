    "description": "The mistreatment of your people by an arcane society (such as Numeriaâ€™s Technic League or the White Witches of Irrisen) has made you particularly eager to inflict harm on those who use arcane magic.",
    "prerequisites": "Spellcraft 1 rank.",
    "benefit": "You deal +2 damage with weapon attacks made against any target you have witnessed casting an arcane spell (not using a spell-like ability) in the last 5 rounds. You must have successfully identified the spell with a Spellcraft check to know without a doubt that the spell is arcane."
