    "description": "A carefully selected set of geodes causes the defenses you create with your spells to offer even better protection.",
    "benefit": "When you cast an abjuration spell using geodes as an esoteric material component, you can grant a single target of that spell a +1 competence bonus on its Fortitude, Reflex, or Will saving throws for the duration of the spell. The spell must have a duration measured in rounds or minutes, and a creature can benefit from no more than one bonus from this feat at a time."
