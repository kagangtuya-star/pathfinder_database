    "source": ["Occult Mysteries pg. 45"],
    "description": "You physically defile yourself out of zealous devotion to pain in order to gain special boons.",
    "prerequisites": "3 ranks in Heal.",
    "benefit": "When you take this feat, select an agony. You can gain this feat multiple times, each time selecting a different agony, but you can perform an obedience for only a single agony in a 24-hour period. Each agony requires a different obedience, but all obediences take only an hour to perform. Once the obedience has been performed, you take a number of minor penalties and gain the benefit of a resistance to some element or attack associated with your agony, as indicated below. Additionally, you gain the ability to make an agony strike. A number of times per day equal to 1 + 1 per every 5 Hit Dice you possess, when you deal damage to a creature, you can declare that attack as an agony strike. In addition to the normal damage dealt by the attack, you cause the target to take the penalties associated with your agony for 1 minute. Incorporeal creatures and creatures that are immune to critical hits are immune to agony strikes.<br><br> If you have at least 12 Hit Dice, you also gain the first boon granted by your agony upon undertaking your obedience. If you have at least 16 Hit Dice, you gain the agony’s second boon as well. If you have 20 Hit Dice or more, you also gain the agony’s third boon. Unless a specific duration or number of uses per day is listed, a boon’s effects are constant.<br><br> If you ever fail to perform a daily obedience, or if you are healed of damage, conditions, or penalties caused in the course of performing your obedience, you lose all access to resistances and boons granted by this feat until you next perform the obedience."
