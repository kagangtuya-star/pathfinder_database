    "description": "You have learned the secret to changing the powers granted by your prayer scroll.",
    "prerequisites": "Jiang-shi",
    "benefit": "You gain the ability to create a different type of prayer scroll. You may create a prayer scroll with this ability by using any strip of parchment and a writing instrument, but doing so requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted work. Swapping your current prayer scroll for a different prepared one is a standard action. When wearing a different prayer scroll, you gain its special abilities, but lose your normal prayer scrollâ€™s immunity to spell completion and spell trigger magic items. Your prayer scrolls can be used only by you, and have no effect when used by other jiang-shis. When you choose this feat, select one of the following prayer scroll types.",
    "special": "You may select this feat multiple times. Each time you do so, choose another ability granted by the feat."
