    "text": "When you channel negative energy, you can heal others in return for their obedience.",
    "prerequisites": "Channel energy 7d6, worshiper of Asmodeus.",
    "benefit": "Once per day when you channel negative energy to deal damage to living creatures, you can grant the effects of channeling positive energy to the faithful of Asmodeus. Worshipers of Asmodeus within the area of your channel recover a number of hit points equal to the amount of negative energy channeled. Non- Asmodeus worshipers within the channeled energy can convert to the worship of Asmodeus as an immediate action in order to gain this healing effect. As long as their conversion is sincere, willing converts gain the healing instead of the damage from the channeled negative energy. Such a conversion can only be undone by an <i>atonement <\/i>or similar effect."
