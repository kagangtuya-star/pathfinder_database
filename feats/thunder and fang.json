    "description": "You have mastered the ancient Shoanti Thunder and Fang fighting style, allowing you to fight with increased effectiveness when wielding an earth breaker and klar.",
    "prerequisites": "Str 15, Two-Weapon Fighting, Weapon Focus (earth breaker), Weapon Focus (klar)",
    "benefit": "You can use an earth breaker as though it were a one-handed weapon. When using an earth breaker in one hand and a klar in your off hand, you retain the shield bonus your klar grants to your Armor Class even when you use it to attack. Treat your klar as a light weapon for the purposes of determining your two-weapon fighting penalty.",
    "normal": "An earth breaker is a two-handed weapon, preventing the use of a klar in one hand without imposing penalties for using the earth breaker one-handed. A klar can be used either as a one-handed weapon or a shield; it does not grant a bonus to AC during rounds in which it is used as a weapon.",
    "special": "This is a combat feat, and may be selected with class features that grant bonus combat feats.",
