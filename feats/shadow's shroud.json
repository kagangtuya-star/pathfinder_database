    "name": "Shadow's Shroud",
    "url": "https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Shadow's%20Shroud",
    "descriptors": ["Conduit"],
    "source": ["Planar Adventures pg. 32"],
    "description": "You can camouflage yourself in shadows and gloom.",
    "prerequisites": "Knowledge (planes) 5 ranks",
    "benefit": "As a swift action, you can shroud yourself in shifting, camouflaging shadow. While shrouded in this fashion, you can attempt Stealth checks as though you had concealment, even in areas of normal or bright light. Creatures that can see normally in supernatural darkness can still see you normally.",
    "special": "Unlike spells like <i>shadow walk<\/i>, which require you to be on a plane that is coterminous with the Shadow Plane, this feat functions even on planes that do not normally share a border with the Shadow Plane. Like all conduit feats, the effects are suppressed when planar travel is forbidden."
