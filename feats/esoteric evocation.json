    "description": "Entropic resin flares from your hand when you use it for an evocation spell, striking a nearby foe.",
    "benefit": "When you cast an evocation spell using entropic resin as an esoteric material component, you can damage one creature adjacent to you. The resin deals 1 point of damage per 2 caster levels of the spell (minimum 1), and matches the damage type of your spell."
