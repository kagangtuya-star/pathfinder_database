    "description": "Entropic resin flares from your hand when you use it for an evocation spell, striking a nearby foe.",
    "benefit": "When you cast an evocation spell using entropic resin as an esoteric material component, you can damage one creature adjacent to you. The resin deals 1 point of damage per 2 caster levels of the spell (minimum 1), and matches the damage type of your spell.<br><br> When you gain entropic resin’s greater component effect with an evocation spell, treat your caster level as an additional 1 higher for determining both the damage dice of the spell and the extra damage from Esoteric Evocation. This also increases the spell’s maximum damage dice if applicable."
