    "text": "Your body is easily lost in the muddy chaos of fighting as a swarm, making your vital areas difficult to target.",
    "prerequisites": "Acrobatics 5 ranks, swarming racial trait.",
    "benefit": "While sharing a square with an ally who has this feat, you gain a 25% chance of negating the additional damage from a successful critical hit or sneak attack; if you negate the damage, it is instead rolled normally. This negation chance doesnâ€™t stack with similar protection provided by any other source, such as the fortification armor special ability."
