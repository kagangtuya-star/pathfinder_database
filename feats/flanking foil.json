    "benefit": "Whenever you hit an adjacent opponent with a melee attack, until the start of your next turn, that opponent does not gain any flanking bonus on attack rolls while it is flanking you and cannot deal sneak attack damage to you. It can still provide a flank for its allies.",

    "staminaText": "When using this feat, you can spend 5 stamina points. If you do, your target cannot flank with its allies against you until the start of your next turn."
