    "source": ["Aquatic Adventures pg. 58"],
    "text": "You’ve spent so much time at unusual pressures that you’ve extended your native range beyond the norms of your species.",
    "prerequisites": "Swim 5 ranks.",
    "benefit": "Add one oceanic zone to your native range when calculating pressure (meaning that you don’t take pressure damage in that range unless instantaneously transported up or down, and even then you adapt to the change all at once rather than 100 feet at a time). Surfacedwellers taking this feat must select the sunlight zone, and aquatic creatures can select any zone either directly above or directly below their native range."
