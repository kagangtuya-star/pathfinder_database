    "prerequisites": "Goblin.",
    "benefit": "You can shout nonsense as a swift action to throw off an enemy. Choose a single target that can hear you. It must attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your level + your Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the target is caught off guard, and it takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls and Strength- and Dexterity-based skill checks until the end of its turn. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this ability again for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect."
