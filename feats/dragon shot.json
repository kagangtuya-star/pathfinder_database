    "benefit": "As a swift action, you can spend 1 grit point to convert your gunâ€™s damage into acid, fire, electricity, or cold damage for 1 round. You can choose a different damage type each time you use this ability. This still counts as a ranged weapon attack for critical hit multipliers and abilities such as Deadly Aim."
