    "description": "You use shadows to confound your enemies’ senses.",
    "prerequisites": "Dex 13, worshiper of Norgorber",
    "benefit": "You can use the light around you to move back and forth from shadow to light again, and your sudden shifting confuses your enemies’ eyes. Each time you move a distance equal to or greater than your speed in areas of normal light or dim light, you gain a +3 dodge bonus to AC until the start of your next turn. Enemies who do not use sight in order to perceive you or are using true seeing or a similar effect ignore this AC bonus. This feat is ineffective in areas of darkness or bright light, where one cannot readily shift between light and shadow."
