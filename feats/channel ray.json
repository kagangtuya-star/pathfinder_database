    "source": ["Ranged Tactics Toolbox pg. 12"],
    "description": "You can focus your channeled energy on a single target.",
    "prerequisites": "Channel energy class feature",
    "benefit": "When you channel energy, you can project a ray from your holy symbol instead of creating a burst. You must succeed at a ranged touch attack to hit an unwilling target; your target is then affected by the channeled energy as normal and receives a saving throw. You need not make an attack roll to affect a willing creature with the ray. The ray has a range of 30 feet per channel energy die, and its save DC is increased by 2."
