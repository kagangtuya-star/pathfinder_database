    "description": "Your deity rewards you for your faithfulness.",
    "prerequisites": "Wis 13, alignment must be within one step of your deity's.",
    "benefit": "When you take this feat, choose one domain granted by your deity. You can use the 1st-level domain ability that clerics of that domain can use a number of times or rounds per day, but you can use it only once per day or 1 round per day, whichever is appropriate. Your effective cleric level in regard to this ability is 1st level. If the domain has a 1st-level ability that does not meet this specification, you cannot use it.",
    "special": "You can take this feat twice. When you take it a second time, you choose another domain granted by your deity.<br><br> If you grossly violate the code of conduct required by your deity, your alignment shifts so that it is more than one step away from your deityâ€™s, or you no longer worship your deity, you lose access to this feat. You can regain it once you atone for your misdeeds to your deity (see the <i>atonement <\/i>spell on page 245 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook<\/i>)."
