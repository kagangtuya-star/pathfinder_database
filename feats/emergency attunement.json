    "text": "You can adapt your defenses to any situation.",
    "prerequisites": "Spellcraft 7 ranks.",
    "benefit": "As a standard action, you can alter one of your ongoing abjuration or transmutation spells. It must be currently affecting you and must grant a choice of options when cast. You change its benefit to a different one from the same list. In order to accomplish this, you must make a successful Spellcraft check (DC equal to 10 + the level of the spell to be altered). The duration of the spell is reduced to half of the spellâ€™s remaining duration. For example, a 7th-level wizard could change her <i>resist energy<\/i> ( fire) spell with 50 minutes of its duration remaining into <i>resist energy<\/i> (cold), but the new duration would be 25 minutes. This ability does not change the benefit for any other creatures targeted by the original spell."
