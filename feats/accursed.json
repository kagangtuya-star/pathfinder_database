    "description": "Your curse weighs down your soul like a millstone around your neck.",
    "prerequisites": "You must carry a curse that can be lifted only by a quest or similar great undertaking, or have the Cursed Birth background.",
    "benefit": "You gain spell resistance equal to 5 + your character level, as the curse interferes with all magic. Unlike most spell resistance, it canâ€™t voluntarily be lowered, though your own spells and magic items still automatically affect you."
