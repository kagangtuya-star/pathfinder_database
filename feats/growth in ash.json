    "text": "Youâ€™re aware that when fire passes, growth can begin.",
    "benefit": "When you succeed at a Reflex save to avoid catching on fire, or when you cease taking ongoing fire damage from a spell or effect, you can smear ash on yourself as an immediate action to gain fast healing 1 for 3 rounds. For every Hit Die you have beyond 3, extend the duration of this fast healing by an additional round."
