    "description": "You have the ability to perfectly emulate a human.",
    "prerequisites": "Change shape ability, shapechanger subtype, must be able to change shape into a human or must have a true form that appears human.",
    "benefit": "You count as both human and your race for the purpose of taking character options, such as archetypes, feats, spells, traits, and prestige classes. In addition, you count as human for all other effects whenever you would otherwise appear human. For instance, a +1 human bane arrow would deal additional damage to a kitsune with this feat while she was in her human form (as per change shape), but not in her true form. Likewise, such an arrow would deal additional damage to a skinwalker with this feat while she was in her true form, but would not in her bestial form (as per change shape)."
