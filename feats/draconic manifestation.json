    "description": "You’ve unlocked more than just the ability to emulate the claws of your draconic forebear.",
    "prerequisites": "Access to natural claw attacks, bloodrager or sorcerer with the draconic bloodline",
    "benefit": "As a free action when manifesting claws (as per the sorcerer bloodline ability), you infuse yourself with other dormant powers of your draconic bloodline. If you’re a bloodrager, you gain the benefits of this feat as a free action, but only while bloodraging; the ability lasts for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. These rounds need not be used consecutively. Depending on the specific draconic bloodline you have, you gain one of the following abilities."
