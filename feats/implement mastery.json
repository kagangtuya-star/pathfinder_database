    "source": ["Magic Tactics Toolbox pg. 30"],
    "text": "You can use your implements to unlock secrets of mastering relics and other items of power.",
    "prerequisites": "Implements class feature, mental focus class feature.",
    "benefit": "For the purposes of using item mastery feats, you treat your implements as magic items with all spells that you know from each implement’s associated implement school functioning as their effective construction requirements. When using an implement to activate an item mastery feat, you can spend a number of points of mental focus equal to half of the feat’s base Fortitude save bonus prerequisite to activate the feat without counting the use against the item mastery feat’s total number of daily uses.",
    "special": "An occultist who has this feat can select item mastery feats in place of focus powers, provided he meets the feats’ prerequisites."
