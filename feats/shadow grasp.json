    "benefit": "When you cast a spell with the darkness descriptor that affects an area, creatures in the area are entangled. If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the entangle effect. If the spell does not normally allow a save, a creature can make a Reflex save (DC = the spell’s DC if it had a saving throw) to negate the effect. If the spell allows spell resistance, failing to overcome a creature’s spell resistance means it is not entangled.<br><br> An entangled creature remains so as long as it is in the area of the spell and for 1 round after it leaves. A creature that leaves and reenters the area must make a new saving throw to avoid becoming entangled. Creatures that succeed at a save to resist being entangled do not have to make additional saves if they stay within the darkened area.<br><br> You are never impeded by the effects of your spells modified by this feat. A Shadow Grasp spell uses up a slot one level higher than the spell’s actual level.",
