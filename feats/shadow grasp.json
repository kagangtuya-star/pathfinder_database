    "benefit": "When you cast a spell with the darkness descriptor that affects an area, creatures in the area are entangled. If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the entangle effect. If the spell does not normally allow a save, a creature can make a Reflex save (DC = the spell’s DC if it had a saving throw) to negate the effect. If the spell allows spell resistance, failing to overcome a creature’s spell resistance means it is not entangled.",
