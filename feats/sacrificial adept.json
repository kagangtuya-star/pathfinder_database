    "prerequisites": "Knowledge (arcana) 4 ranks, Knowledge (planes) 4 ranks, Knowledge (religion) 4 ranks, Spellcraft 4 ranks, ability to cast 3rd-level spells, evil alignment",
    "benefit": "By partaking in a heinous ritual that takes at least 10 minutes to complete and which requires you to perform a successful coup de grace upon a sacrifice, you can enhance the power of a single spell you know or have prepared for the next 24 hours, regardless of how many times you cast it within that period. Your sacrifice must be a sentient creature with a total number of Hit Dice greater than or equal to your caster level, and it must die from your coup de grace; if it doesnâ€™t die or comes back to life, you lose all benefits related to that sacrifice."
