    "description": "A past humiliation haunts you to this day.",
    "prerequisites": "You must have been publicly embarrassed, or must have the Bastard Born background. If the embarrassment didn't cause significant harm to your personal honor or social standing, it does not qualify for the feat prerequisites. The humiliation doesn't need to have been unjustified.",
    "benefit": "Being observed drives you to excel. When youâ€™re in a conflict that is being observed by others not involved in the conflict, you gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and skill checks."
