    "prerequisites": "Evil alignment",
    "benefit": "When casting <i>summon monster<\/i>, you also have access to the list of evil monsters on this page. When summoning a creature from this list, your debased nature allows you to cast the spell as a standard action. The summoned creature appears as normal for the spell but can’t act until next your next turn. It is not flat-footed, however, and it can make attacks of opportunity as normal. These effects don’t apply for creatures from the standard list that aren’t also on this list.",
    "special": "If you possess the Sacred Summons<sup>UM<\/sup> feat, you can apply it to a creature on this list whose alignment (as opposed to its subtype or subtypes) matches your aura."
