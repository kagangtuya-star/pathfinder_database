    "description": "Like a dolphin, you can quickly dart at a foe and retreat.",
    "prerequisites": "Dolphin Style, Improved Unarmed Strike, Swim 6 ranks, base attack bonus +6 or monk level 6th",
    "benefit": "While in Dolphin Style, as a standard action underwater you can move up to half your swim speed, make a single melee attack against a creature within your reach, and then retreat back to your previous position. Your movement and attack donâ€™t provoke attacks of opportunity, even if your foe has an ability that allows attacks of opportunity with triggers other than moving out of a threatened area.",
