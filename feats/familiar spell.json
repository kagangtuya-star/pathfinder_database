    "benefit": "You can transfer a prepared spell to your familiar, allowing the familiar to cast that spell at a later time. Variables that rely on caster level function according to your caster level, not your familiar’s Hit Dice, though your familiar’s Intelligence may influence how precisely it can follow your instructions on how to use these spells.",
    "special": "If you are a spontaneous caster, you must select a specific spell with which to imbue your familiar; you cannot imbue your familiar with an open spell slot."
