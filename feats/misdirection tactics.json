    "benefit": "While you are using the total defense action, if a melee attack would still hit your AC, you can attempt a Bluff check with a DC equal to the foe’s attack roll as an immediate action. If you succeed at the check, you negate the attack (treat it as a miss). If the attack still hits, you cannot use this feat against the same opponent for 24 hours.",
