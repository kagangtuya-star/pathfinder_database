    "prerequisites": "Knowledge (religion) 6 ranks, Spell Focus (necromancy)",
    "benefit": "A thanatopic spell pierces defenses and immunities that protect against death effects, negative levels, and energy drain, affecting the target as if the protective barrier did not exist. For example, you could cast a thanatopic <i>vampiric touch <\/i>or <i>enervation <\/i>spell on a target under the effects of <i>death ward<\/i>, and the target would suffer the normal effect of the spell. Saving throws and SR (if any) still apply.",
    "normal": "Defenses such as <i>death ward <\/i>negate death effects, negative levels, and energy drain. Undead are immune to these attacks.",
