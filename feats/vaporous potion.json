    "benefit": "When you brew a potion, you can brew it in such a way that when exposed suddenly to air and force, it diffuses into a cloud of vapor that can be inhaled. The potion can still be consumed normally, but it can also be delivered by throwing it at another creature as a splash weapon. The potion vial has a range increment of 10 feet and is considered an improvised weapon. On impact, the vial breaks and a cloud of barely visible potion vapor fills the square it lands in (this vapor does not obscure normal sight in any way). If a creature is in that square, it gains the benefits of the potion immediately as though it had imbibed the potion.",
