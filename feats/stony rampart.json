    "description": "Stone rises up at your command, offering cover to allies.",
    "prerequisites": "Knowledge (planes) 3 ranks",
    "benefit": "As a standard action, you can call forth a low wall of unworked stone along any side of a square within 30 feet. This wall is 5 feet long, 3 feet high, 2 inches thick, and acts as a low obstacle, except that it provides only partial cover. A single 5-foot section of stone created by this feat has hardness 8 and 30 hp. You can only have one such wall in existence at a time for every 5 ranks in Knowledge (planes) you have (minimum 1); walls last for a number of rounds equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes) before crumbling to dust. If you have 10 or more ranks in Knowledge (planes), you can create multiple walls as a single standard action by expending an equivalent number of uses of this ability."
