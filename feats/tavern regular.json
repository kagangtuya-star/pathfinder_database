    "benefit": "You receive a 10% discount at any tavern after you have spent a cumulative 500 gp there. In addition, if a bar fight occurs in that tavern, you gain a +2 bonus on your checks to use the redirect action. On a round in which you donâ€™t attempt the redirect action, the crowd reduces your tenacity by only 1d4 (instead of by the normal amount)."
