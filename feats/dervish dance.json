    "prerequisites": "Dexterity 13, Weapon Finesse, Perform (dance) 2 ranks, proficient with scimitar.",
    "benefit": "When wielding a scimitar with one hand, you can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on melee attack and damage rolls. You treat the scimitar as a one-handed piercing weapon for all feats and class abilities that require such a weapon (such as a duelistâ€™s precise strike ability). The scimitar must be for a creature of your size. You cannot use this feat if you are carrying a weapon or shield in your off hand.",
