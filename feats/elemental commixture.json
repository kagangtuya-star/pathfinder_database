    "description": "You can combine your elemental spells with those of your allies to produce entirely new and synergistic magical effects.",
    "prerequisites": "Caster level 1st",
    "benefit": "You and an ally within 30 feet who shares this feat can cast your spells together to create a more powerful, hybrid effect. Both spells must have an elemental descriptor (air, earth, fire, or water), or an energy descriptor that corresponds to one of the elements (acid [earth], cold [water], electricity [air], or fire [fire]) . Both spells must be at least 1st level, within 1 spell level of each other, and cast during the same initiative turn through the use of readied actions.",
    "special": "An inquisitor or any other character with the solo tactics class feature can use this teamwork feat without the aid of an ally. In order to do so, the character must be able to cast two qualifying spells within the same round, such as by using the Quicken Spell metamagic feat to cast one spell as a swift action or by using effects such as the <i>time stop<\/i> spell."
