    "description": "You hold no fear of blindness, as your other senses improve without the distractions of sight.",
    "prerequisites": "Blind-Fight, Perception 5 ranks",
    "benefit": "While you are using this style, you gain a number of benefits whenever you are blinded or unable to see (including when you wear a blindfold or close your eyes). Under such circumstances, you do not take any penalties on Strength- or Dexterity-based skill checks due to blindness. In addition, you gain a +4 bonus on hearing- and smell-based Perception checks and gain the scent special ability with a range of 10 feet; if you already have scent, the range of your scent ability increases by 10 feet instead. Having this feat counts as having 10 ranks in Perception for the purpose of satisfying the prerequisites of the Improved Blind-Fight<sup>APG<\/sup> feat, as well as any feat that lists Improved Blind-Fight<sup>APG<\/sup> as a prerequisite.",
