    "description": "Your resemblance to a human child tends to make others trust you, perhaps more than they should.",
    "prerequisites": "Cha 13, halfling",
    "benefit": "You can take 10 on Bluff checks to convince others you are telling the truth, so long as your story makes you appear innocent. You gain a +2 bonus on Disguise skill checks to pose as a human child, and ignore the check penalties for disguising yourself as a different race and age category while doing so."
