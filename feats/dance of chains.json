    "prerequisites": "Dex 15, Chain Mastery, Exotic Weapon Proficiency (spiked chain), Weapon Finesse, Perform (dance) 1 rank.",
    "benefit": "When wielding a spiked chain one-handed, you can add your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to that weaponâ€™s damage. The spiked chain must be one appropriate for your size. During your turn, you treat your reach with the spiked chain as 5 feet greater. You lose these benefits while fighting with multiple weapons or when using a shield (but not when using a buckler).",
