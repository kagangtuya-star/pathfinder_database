    "text": "When you strike from the cover of darkness, you inject foes with a fraction of your foul magic.",
    "prerequisites": "Base attack bonus +5, <i>darkness <\/i>spell-like ability, sneak attack class feature, tiefling.",
    "benefit": "When you successfully deal sneak attack damage to a foe while you are within an area of magical darkness, you temporarily blind your opponent for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + the amount of sneak attack damage dealt) negates this effect."
