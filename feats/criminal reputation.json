    "prerequisites": "Diplomacy 5 ranks, Intimidate 5 ranks.",
    "benefit": "You gain a +2 bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks when interacting with criminals, whether theyâ€™re individual thieves and cutpurses or criminal organizations. If you have 10 or more ranks in one of these skills, the bonus increases to +4 for that skill.<br><br> These bonuses do not stack with those granted by Persuasive, but this feat counts as Persuasive for the purposes of feats and other rules elements with Persuasive as a prerequisite."
