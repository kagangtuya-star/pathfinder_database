    "description": "With a mighty killing blow, your unsettling punch vaporizes your foe.",
    "prerequisites": "Wis 19, Cha 15, Improved Unarmed Strike, Maddening Strike, Maddening Style, Stunning Fist, Knowledge (arcana) 10 ranks, ki pool class feature, nongood alignment.",
    "benefit": "When you damage a living creature with an unarmed strike while using Maddening Style, and you have at least 1 point in your ki pool, that creature suffers a â€“2 penalty on saving throws against any confusion, madness, and insanity effects (including your Maddening Strike) for 1 round. Additionally, if you reduce a creature to fewer than 0 hit points with a Stunning Fist attack, you can spend 2 points from your ki pool as a free action to obliterate your opponent, reducing their body to fine dust as per disintegrate. A living creature can attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier) to negate this effect.",
