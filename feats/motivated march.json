    "source": ["Monster Codex pg. 117"],
    "description": "Years of forcing your slaves and soldiers to march far beyond the limits of their endurance have made you an excellent taskmaster.",
    "benefit": "When traveling overland, you and a number of allies equal to 10 times your character level reduce the amount of nonlethal damage taken as a result of a forced march by half. Creatures benefiting from this feat can delay the fatigued effect of a forced march for a number of hours equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). A creature that delays this effect becomes exhausted instead of fatigued when the condition takes effect."
