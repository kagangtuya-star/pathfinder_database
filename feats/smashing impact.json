    "benefit": "Whenever you successfully bull rush an enemy and its movement is stopped by a solid object or barrier, you can deal your unarmed strike damage to both the foe and the object or barrier, as long as the enemy is within your threatened area. If you performed your bull rush as part of a charge, you gain a +2 bonus on your damage roll. If the damage is enough to destroy the object or barrier, you can continue to push your target the remaining distance allowed by your bull rush combat maneuver.",
    "normal": "You canâ€™t bull rush a creature into a solid object or barrier.",
