    "description": "Your rigorous training allows you to redirect some of the energy from blows you take, turning your enemies’ strength against them. Even death can’t stop you from having your revenge.",
    "prerequisites": "Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, Linnorm Style, base attack bonus +6 or monk level 6th",
    "benefit": "While you’re using the Linnorm Style feat and an enemy hits you with a melee attack, you gain a +2 bonus on unarmed strike attack rolls you make against that creature until the beginning of that creature’s next turn. If a creature’s melee attack would normally miss you, you can allow it to hit you to gain this bonus; the attack deals the minimum amount of damage (as  though the attacker had rolled a natural 1 on each damage die).",
