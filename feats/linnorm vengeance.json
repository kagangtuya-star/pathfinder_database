    "prerequisites": "Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, Linnorm Style, base attack bonus +6 or monk level 6th.",
    "benefit": "While you’re using the Linnorm Style feat and an enemy hits you with a melee attack, you gain a +2 bonus on unarmed strike attack rolls you make against that creature until the beginning of that creature’s next turn. If a creature’s melee attack would normally miss you, you can allow it to hit you to gain this bonus; the attack deals the minimum amount of damage (as  though the attacker had rolled a natural 1 on each damage die). <br><br> Furthermore, if a melee attack deals enough damage toknock you unconscious or kill you, you can make a single retaliatory unarmed strike attack against that opponent as a free action before you drop unconscious or die. If you do so, when you are restored to consciousness or to life, you are stunned for 1 round.",
