    "descriptors": ["Story"],
    "source": ["Agents of Evil pg. 8"],
    "text": "Believing in a just cause left you with a knife in your back. Now you hoard your trust in others, rarely sharing it.",
    "prerequisites": "You must have had a valuable item (worth at least 1, 000 gp per character level) stolen by a former ally, have been left for dead by a former ally, or have the Wrong Enemy background.",
    "benefit": "When you are in a harmful area of effect created by an ally (through a spell or other means), you can roll your saving throw twice and take the better result. If you do so, your shaken trust means you do not provide flanking bonuses to any allies for 1 hour.",
    "goal": "Track down the people who betrayed you, and either bring them to justice or slay them. At the GMâ€™s discretion, certain members of this group can be spared if they provide important information leading to more prominent targets.",
    "completionBenefit": "You grow more confident in reading others, if not exactly more trusting of them. Your allies and enemies no longer provide cover bonuses on attacks you make against other creatures. You also gain a 20% miss chance against any attacks of opportunity made against you, as long as an ally is threatening the creature making the attack."
