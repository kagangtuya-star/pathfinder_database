    "source": ["Dirty Tactics Toolbox pg. 17"],
    "description": "The goddess of lust, revenge, and trickery has granted you a living sting to show her favor in you.",
    "prerequisites": "Chaotic neutral alignment, worshiper of Calistria",
    "benefit": "You gain a familiar as per the arcane bond class feature, using your character level as your wizard level. The familiar is a cat-sized, chaotic neutral wasp loyal to you. Use the statistics for a greensting scorpion familiar (<i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic<\/i> 188), but give it a base speed of 10 feet, a fly speed of 40 feet (average), no Climb bonus, and Fly +7. If you have the ability to gain a familiar through other means (such as the arcane bond class feature), and you are at least 5th level, instead use the statistics for an imp, but replace the <i>invisibility<\/i> spell-like ability with an <i>unnatural lust<\/i><sup>UM<\/sup> (DC 14) spell-like ability usable three times per day. You can have only one familiar.",
    "special": "This feat can be taken a second time by characters of 7th or higher level if they do not otherwise have access to familiars. Such characters have access to a wasp familiar that uses the statistics for an imp, as described above."
