    "description": "Your phantom remains partly immaterial even when fully manifested in ectoplasmic form.",
    "prerequisites": "Phantom class feature, phantom with the incorporeal flight ability.",
    "benefit": "Your phantom has a 50% chance of ignoring critical hits and precision-based damage when fully manifested in its ectoplasmic form, as if wearing armor with the <i>moderate fortification<\/i> special ability. This doesn’t stack with other similar effects, and doesn’t apply against attacks made with <i>ghost touch<\/i> weapons or weaponlike constructs made of force (such as a <i>clenched fist<\/i>, <i>mage’s sword<\/i>, or <i>spiritual weapon<\/i>)."
