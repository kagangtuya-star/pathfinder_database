    "benefit": "Whenever you make an attack or cast a spell that deals fire damage, the fire damage applies to incorporeal creatures, regardless of whether the fire is magical. An incorporeal creature’s 50% reduction in damage from corporeal sources does not apply to any fire damage that you deal."
