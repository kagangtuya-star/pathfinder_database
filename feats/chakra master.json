    "prerequisites": "Chakra Adept, Chakra Initiate, ability to awaken the crown chakra",
    "benefit": "Your pool of serpent-fire ki increases to 5 points. You can spend 3 ki points instead of 1 when you open or maintain a chakra to gain the benefits of two chakras instead of one in that round. If you are opening or maintaining your crown chakra, this stacks with the crown chakraâ€™s special power, allowing you to gain the benefits of three chakras in a round.",
