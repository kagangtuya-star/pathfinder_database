    "benefit": "While feinting with a melee weapon that has “gnome” in its name, you can sacrifice a spell slot, a spell of the illusion school, or a spell from the gnome magic racial trait to gain a bonus on the skill check attempted to feint. This bonus is equal to 1 + the level of the spell sacrificed. If you sacrifice a 0-level spell, you cannot cast or sacrifice that spell again for 24 hours.",
