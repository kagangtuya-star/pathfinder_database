    "text": "Through dedicated study and training, you can resist the control of possessing spirits.",
    "benefit": "You gain a +2 competence bonus on Knowledge checks to identify creatures with the incorporeal subtype, and can attempt Knowledge checks dealing with incorporeal creatures untrained. When affected by a <i>dominate person<\/i>, <i>magic jar<\/i>, or <i>possession<\/i> spell or a similar ability, your mind and soul remain aware within your body, at war with the invading consciousness. While dominated or possessed, you can attempt a Will save as a swift action to temporarily regain control over your body. On a successful save, you can act normally for 1 round. On a failed save, you cannot attempt to regain control for 1 hour, but the possessing consciousness canâ€™t take a swift action that round."
