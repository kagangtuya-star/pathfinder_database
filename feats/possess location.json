    "description": "A fiend learns to disperse its essence over an area, gaining mastery over features and structures there and tainting the place with its wickedness.",
    "prerequisites": "Cha 16, any evil outsider with 8 or more Hit Dice",
    "benefit": "Once per day, as a full-round action, a fiend may attempt to possess a structure or small area (like a pool, grove, or ruin) of a diameter equal to 10 feet per Hit Die. This area is spherical, so a fiend possessing a particularly large structure might only have power over a certain number of rooms. An area receives no save against fiendish possession unless creatures or magical items occupy the space, in which case the area makes a Will save equal to 10 + half the fiend's Hit Dice + the fiend's Charisma modifier using the stats of the occupant with the highest Will save. An area within the effects of a <i>hallow<\/i> spell cannot be possessed. A fiend possessing an area operates similarly to one using the Possess Creature feat, except that locations do not receive daily saves to escape the fiend's influence and the fiend's possession points can only be spent on location possession actions."
