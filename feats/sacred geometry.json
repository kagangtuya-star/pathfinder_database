    "benefit": "When you take this feat, select two metamagic feats you do not yet have. When casting a spell, you can perform the steps below to spontaneously apply the effects of either or both of these metamagic feats, as well as any other metamagic feats you have, to the spell without expending a higher-level spell slot. Using a feat in this way increases the spell’s casting time to the casting time it would take if the character were a sorcerer or bard (sorcerers and bards using this ability increase the spell’s casting time by two categories; see page 113 of the <i>Core Rulebook<\/i>); applying the Quicken Spell metamagic effect negates the increased casting time but still contributes to the modified spell’s effective spell level. You can take this feat more than once; each time, select two additional metamagic feats, adding their effects to the list of possible effects you can apply to spells with this ability.<br><br> When casting a spell using Sacred Geometry, first determine the effective spell level of the modified spell you are attempting to cast (calculated as normal for a spell modified by metamagic feats). You can apply any number of metamagic effects to a single spell, provided you are able to cast spells of the modified spell’s effective spell level.<br><br> <table class=\"inner\"><tr><td>"
