    "benefit": "As a swift action, you can spend 1 panache point to enrage a creature with an Intelligence of 4 or more within 60 feet that can see or hear you. Attempt an Intimidate check as if to demoralize the creature. If you succeed, the creature takes a –2 penalty to its AC until it has made at least one attack against you (including area effects that include you) or until it can no longer see or hear you. You can have only one opponent enraged at you with this feat at a time, and once you’ve enraged a creature, you can’t enrage it again for 24 hours.",
