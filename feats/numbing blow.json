    "benefit": "Whenever you succeed at a combat maneuver check to disarm an opponent, the opponent must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + your base attack bonus) or be hampered by the pain of the blow. For 1 round, if the target of your disarm combat maneuver failed its save, it canâ€™t use the limb or limbs that had been wielding the disarmed weapon to wield a weapon or shield, provide somatic components for spells, or manipulate objects. This is a pain effect.",
