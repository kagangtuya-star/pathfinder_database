    "prerequisites": "Knowledge (nature) 5 ranks, ability to spontaneously cast cure or inflict spells, Animal or Plant domain",
    "benefit": "You can “lose” a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature’s ally<\/i> spell of the same level or lower, instead of casting a cure spell or an inflict spell as you normally would. For the purpose of this feat only, the <i>summon nature's ally<\/i> spells of the appropriate spell levels count as being on your spell list at the same spell level as for a druid."
