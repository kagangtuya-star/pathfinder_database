    "prerequisites": "Implements class feature.",
    "benefit": "When you are within 30 feet of your implement, you don’t need to attempt a concentration check to cast spells associated with that implement. When you are at a greater distance, the DC for the concentration check is equal to 15 + the spell’s level.",
    "normal": "Anytime you attempt to cast a spell using an implement that’s not in your possession, you must succeed at a concentration check with a DC equal to 20 + the spell’s level in order to cast the spell.",
    "special": "You can take this feat multiple times. Its effects don’t stack. Each time you take the feat, you gain the benefits for a different school of implements. If you have more than one implement of a single school, you can select that school multiple times and apply the benefits to another one of those implements each time you take this feat and select that school."
