    "description": "A strike made with a two-handed weapon can push a similar sized opponent backward.",
    "prerequisites": "Str 15, Power Attack, base attack bonus +1",
    "benefit": "When you hit a creature your size or smaller with a two-handed weapon attack modified by the Power Attack feat, you can choose to push the target 5 feet directly away from you instead of dealing the extra damage from Power Attack. If you score a critical hit, you can instead push the target 10 feet directly away from you. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunities, and the target must end this move in a safe space it can stand in. You choose which effect to apply after the attack roll has been made, but before the damage is rolled.",
