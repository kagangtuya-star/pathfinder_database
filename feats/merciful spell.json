    "description": "Your damaging spells subdue rather than kill.",
    "benefit": "You can alter spells that inflict damage to inflict nonlethal damage instead. Spells that inflict damage of a particular type (such as fire) inflict nonlethal damage of that same type. A merciful spell does not use up a higher-level spell slot than the spellâ€™s actual level."
