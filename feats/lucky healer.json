    "description": "Your luck allows you to draw from magical healing far more efficiently than most.",
    "prerequisites": "Adaptive luck racial trait, halfling",
    "benefit": "When a magical healing effect (such as a spell with \"cure\" in the title or channel energy) cures you, you can spend one use of your adaptable luck racial trait to reroll the amount of damage cured. You regain a number of hit points equal to the new roll or the original roll, whichever is greater. Other creatures healed by the effect do not gain this benefit."
