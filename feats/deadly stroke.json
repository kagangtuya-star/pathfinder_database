    "prerequisites": "Dazzling Display, Greater Weapon Focus, Shatter Defenses, Weapon Focus, proficiency with the selected weapon, base attack bonus +11.",
    "benefit": "As a standard action, make a single attack with the weapon for which you have Greater Weapon Focus against a stunned or flat-footed opponent. If you hit, you deal double the normal damage and the target takes 1 point of Constitution bleed (see Conditions). The additional damage and bleed is not multiplied on a critical hit.",

    "staminaText": "You can spend 5 stamina points to make a Deadly Stroke attack against a dazed opponent, or 10 stamina points to make a Deadly Stroke against an opponent you are flanking.",

    "mythicBenefit": "When making a Deadly Stroke attack, you can expend one use of mythic power to instantly kill a nonmythic living creature. A Fortitude save (DC 10 + your base attack bonus + your tier) negates this effect, though the attack still deals double damage and Con bleed as Deadly Stroke. Constructs, oozes, and creatures immune to critical hits or precision-based damage can’t be killed with this feat.",
