    "description": "Thrown weapons fly from your hands as if blown by a gale, and you leave behind a wake of wind as you move.",
    "prerequisites": "Dex 13; Wis 13; Dodge; Mobility; Perfect Style; Quick Draw; Unfolding Wind Strike; base attack bonus +13 or monk level 13th.",
    "benefit": "When using Perfect Style and wielding thrown weapons, you can combine a full-attack action with a single move action. You must forgo the attack at your highest bonus but can take the remaining attacks as normal at any point during your movement. You can spend 1 ki point as a swift action to create a path of wind along your path of movement that functions as <i>wind wall<\/i> for 1 round; this effect does not affect your ranged attacks.",

    "staminaText": "You can spend 2 stamina points instead of 1 ki point when using Unfolding Wind Rush.",
