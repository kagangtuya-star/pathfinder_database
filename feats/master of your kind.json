    "benefit": "Your master gains a +2 bonus on Handle Animal checks with animals of your kind. In addition, once per day you can use <i>animal messenger<\/i>, <i>animal trance<\/i>, or <i>charm animal <\/i>as a spell-like ability, using your masterâ€™s caster level but your own Charisma modifier. These abilities affect only animals of your kind, and you gain only one use of this ability per day (not one of each ability); however, you can gain one additional use of any one of these three abilities by having your master sacrifice a prepared spell or spell slot of the same level or higher as a standard action."
