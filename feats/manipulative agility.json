    "url": "https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Manipulative%20Agility",
    "source": ["Ultimate Intrigue pg. 86"],
    "text": "You can use your agility to manipulate people as well as small objects.",
    "prerequisites": "Bluff 1 rank, Sleight of Hand 1 rank.",
    "benefit": "You can use Sleight of Hand in place of Bluff for checks to feint in combat, as well as for checks to pass secret messages without being noticed (by using gestures and body language). In both cases, the effects become visual and don’t work if the target or recipient is blind or cannot see you. In the case of secret messages, the limitations of hand gestures and body language might impact what sorts of messages you can pass, at the GM’s discretion."
