    "text": "Your godâ€™s power radiates from your warhammer.",
    "prerequisites": "Ability to cast 3rd-level divine spells, proficient with warhammer, worshiper of Torag.",
    "benefit": "You can use any warhammer you wield as a holy symbol when casting spells that require a divine focus or when you channel energy.<br><br> Furthermore, as a swift action when you cast a divine touch spell, you can choose to have the warhammer carry the charge of the spell instead of your hand. When you deliver a touch spell with your warhammer you can do so as part of melee attack made with the warhammer. If you drop the warhammer or the warhammer is disarmed while carrying a charge, the charge is lost."
