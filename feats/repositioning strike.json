    "benefit": "Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee attack, you can move your opponent, in addition to the normal damage dealt by the attack. If your confirmation roll exceeds your opponent’s CMD, you may move your opponent as if from the reposition combat maneuver. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.",
    "normal": "You must perform a reposition combat maneuver to reposition an opponent.",
    "special": "You can only apply the effects of one of the following feats to a given critical hit: Bull Rush Strike, Disarming Strike, Repositioning Strike, Sundering Strike, or Tripping Strike. You may choose to use this feat after you make your confirmation roll.",
    "staminaSource": ["Pathfinder Unchained pg. 130"],
    "staminaText": "When you fail to confirm a critical hit with a melee attack, you can spend 2 stamina points to attempt to reposition the target anyway. If you do, reroll the confirmation roll and use it to determine if the reposition<sup>APG<\/sup> attempt exceeds the opponent’s CMD. This reroll is used only for the reposition combat maneuver; it can’t cause the critical hit to be confirmed. You still can’t make the attempt if the target is immune to critical hits.",
