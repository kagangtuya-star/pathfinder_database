    "prerequisites": "Con 13",
    "benefit": "You gain a vigor pool with a maximum number of points equal to your Constitution bonus. As a standard action, you can spend up to 1 vigor point per 3 Hit Dice you have (minimum 1) to regain 1d6 hit points per vigor point spent (maximum 7d6). Each time you spend vigor points, you become fatigued for 1 minute. You cannot spend vigor points while fatigued or exhausted. Spending vigor points doesnâ€™t provoke attacks of opportunity. The points in your vigor pool are replenished to their maximum after you rest for 8 hours."
