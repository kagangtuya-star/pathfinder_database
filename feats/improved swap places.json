    "benefit": "When you and your ally use Swap Places, your ally can be up to one size larger or smaller than you, and your movement into the ally’s square does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If your ally cannot fit into the space you had been occupying and there are no available adjacent squares to accommodate the rest of the ally’s space, the ally must squeeze. Alternatively, as part of its movement, the ally can attempt a bull rush combat maneuver against a creature that occupies a space your ally would occupy, but this bull rush cannot move the creature more than 5 feet.",
    "normal": "Using Swap Places requires you and your ally to be the same size, and your movement into the ally’s square provokes attacks of opportunity.",

    "staminaText": "When you attempt a bull rush when using this feat, you can spend 2 stamina points to gain the ability to move the target of that combat maneuver more than 5 feet if necessary to create space for your ally (you must still roll high enough on the bull rush attempt to move the target an extra distance, as normal).",
