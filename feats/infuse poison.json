    "prerequisites": "Brew Potion, Craft (alchemy) 5 ranks, caster level 3rd.",
    "benefit": "You can infuse an ingested poison with any spell of 3rd level or lower that you know and that targets one or more creatures and has a casting time of less than 1 minute. Infusing a poison takes 2 hours if its base price is 250 gp or less; otherwise, infusing a poison takes 1 day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. When you infuse a poison, you set the caster level, which must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own caster level. To infuse a poison, you must use up raw materials costing half of its base price.<br><br> When you create an infused poison, you make any choices that you would normally make when casting the spell.<br><br> Whoever ingests the infused poison is the target of the spell.",
