You determine which allies you want to teleport at the time of casting; these allies have 1 round to decide to allow or refuse your spell, and they teleport immediately upon accepting. Allies are teleported as if you had cast teleport on them (your current location is at least “studied carefully” for this purpose), appearing in a puff of brimstone in a space adjacent to you. If you are in combat and your allies were not, your allies may roll initiative upon arrival but are not considered fat-footed even though they have not taken any actions. The spell does not function in areas warded against intrusion by evil creatures (such as a magic circle against evil effect).<\/p>",
