If you’re 5th tier and expend three uses of mythic power, the duration increases to 10 years per tier. If you’re 5th tier and expend four uses of mythic power, the spell has both augmented effects. Creatures sleeping for years because of this spell age and breathe as normal, but don’t need to eat or drink while the spell lasts. ",
