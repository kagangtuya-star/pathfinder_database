    "text": "You harness divine power to create one of four different  ceremonies—a funeral, holiday fete, marriage, or naming—and  can also create two domain-based ceremonies. Each ceremony  provides a boon to two living, touched subjects for 1 hour per  caster level, representing the divine gifts granted by your deity  as well as the normal morale-boosting benefits of participating  in an officiated ceremony. Bonuses granted by these boons  are sacred bonuses if you channel positive energy or profane  bonuses if you channel negative energy. (Bonuses in this section  are referred to simply as sacred bonuses for ease of reading.)  Only subjects whose alignments are within one step of your  deity can be affected by this spell. <br><br>If you are using the downtime system from <i>Pathfinder  RPG Ultimate Campaign<\/i>, you may use additional resources to  augment the effect of a particular ceremony. You may spend  10 Goods, Labor, or Influence or 2 Magic to create a larger  ceremony and grant an additional boon that lasts for 1 day per  caster level (up to a maximum of 5 days). The type of capital  spent should reflect the preparation required for the specific  ceremony. Augmented boons affect the creatures touched as  well as a number of intelligent, properly aligned creatures within  medium range equal to your caster level (up to a maximum of 10  creatures), granting all subjects the benefits of the original boon  as well as the benefits of an augmented boon, representing the  divine gifts granted to these witnesses by your god. <br><br>Unless otherwise stated, use-activated abilities are supernatural  abilities and abilities that emulate the effects of a spell are  spell-like abilities; in either case, abilities granted by a boon  are generally usable only once or until the duration of the spell  ends, whichever comes first. Spell-like abilities are cast at a  creature’s highest caster level gained, or, if the creature has  no caster level, CL 1st. Constant or passive effects and bonuses  granted by this spell can be dispelled as normal, using your  caster level to do so.  ",
