    "text": "<p>An immobile curtain of illumination springs into existence. When created, one side of the wall (designated by you) radiates bright light to a range of 60 feet away from that side while the other side radiates darkness to an equal distance. This effect alters the illumination level by up to two steps toward either bright light (the light side) or darkness (the dark side). The wall also obstructs vision through it, regardless of which side of the wall the viewer is on.<\/p><p>Whereas the shadows that permeate the Material Plane merely denote the absence of light, the darkness of the Shadow Plane is in part created by the Negative Energy Plane. The Shadow Plane is home to beings and structures twisted by this influence into pale, quasi-real reflections of true creatures and objects native to the Material Plane. Closely tied to the forces that animate undead and abounding with phantasmal figments, shadow magic is heavily associated with the schools of illusion and necromancy. The following new spells use the energy of the Shadow Plane to fuel their effects.<\/p>",
