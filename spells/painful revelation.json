When a creature successfully disbelieves an illusion that is the target of <i>painful revelation<\/i>, it takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage for every 2 caster levels you have (maximum 10d6) and is staggered for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save reduces the nonlethal damage by half and negates the staggered effect. Once <i>painful revelation<\/i> has been triggered, the spell ends.<br><br> However, creatures under the effect of spells such as <i>true seeing<\/i> that automatically pierce illusions are not subject to this effect.",
