Strong stimulants, effects that increase the target’s Constitution, or physical trauma (such as taking 10 or more points of damage from a single attack) negate the spell immediately. Creatures that do not need to breathe are immune to this spell. The target is considered to have taken a dose of pesh for the purpose of addiction and withdrawal effects. Canny sahir use this spell to subtly kill enemies, as the spell mimics a pesh overdose.",
