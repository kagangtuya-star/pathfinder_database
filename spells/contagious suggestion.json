The target is compelled to communicate your suggestion to another creature, forcing the new target to attempt a saving throw as if it were the initial target. If a secondary target successfully saves, the suggestion effect on the initial target isn't negated. If a secondary target fails, it is placed under the same compulsion as the initial target and can further spread the suggestion. This spell can affect a total number of Hit Dice of creatures equal to your caster level.<\/p><p>Creatures that save against this spell cannot be affected by that particular casting of <i>contagious suggestion<\/i> for 24 hours.<\/p>",
