It gains the benefits of the Multiattack and Multiweapon Fighting feats.<\/li>  <li><b>Malenti<\/b>: The sahuagin's features shift to resemble those of an aquatic elf.

It also gains a +2 enhancement bonus to its natural armor.<\/li>  <li><b>Shark-Blooded<\/b>: The sahuagin's tail elongates and melds with its legs. Its mouth enlarges, increasing its bite damage by one size category (to 1d6 for a typical sahuagin). Its swim speed increases by 20 feet, but its land speed is reduced to 5 feet. The sahuagin can't be tripped.<\/li>  <li><b>Sightless<\/b>: The sahuagin is blinded, but gains the benefits of the Blind Fight feat and blindsense with a range of 90 feet.<\/li>  <li><b>Spined<\/b>: Spines grow on the sahuagin's scales. Any creature that successfully grapples with it, is grappled by it, or hits it with an unarmed strike or natural weapon takes 1d4 points of piercing damage.
