This spell opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve to hold something shut). If used to open an <i>arcane locked<\/i> door, the spell does not remove the <i>arcane lock<\/i> but simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes. In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own. <i>Knock<\/i> does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like. The effect is limited by the area. Each casting can undo as many as two means of preventing access.",

If used on a door locked with <i>arcane lock<\/i>, you can attempt a free dispel check against it as if using a targeted <i>dispel magic<\/i>, adding your tier to the check. <br><br><b>Augmented (3rd)<\/b>: You can expend two uses of mythic power to target one locked item per tier, unlocking up to four means of closure on each, allowing a free dispel against an <i>arcane lock<\/i> on each, and automatically opening locks of up to good quality (no caster level check needed).<br><br> If the door has a trap that triggers when opened, you become aware of the trap and its general nature, and the door is unlocked but doesn’t automatically open.<br><br> The spell can raise a barred gate, portcullis, or similar impediment, but each one counts as two locked doors.
