    "text": "<p>This spell functions like fireball, except that it is more powerful and can detonate up to 5 rounds after the spell is cast. The burst of flame deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). The glowing bead created by <i>delayed blast fireball<\/i> can detonate immediately if you desire, or you can choose to delay the burst for as many as 5 rounds. You select the amount of delay upon completing the spell, and that time cannot change once it has been set unless someone touches the bead. If you choose a delay, the glowing bead sits at its destination until it detonates. A creature can pick up and hurl the bead as a thrown weapon (range increment 10 feet). If a creature handles and moves the bead within 1 round of its detonation, there is a 25% chance that the bead detonates while being handled.<\/p>",

    "text_zh": "<p>该法术的功能如同‘<a href=\"spell.html?spell=fireball\">火球术 (fireball)<\/a>’一般，不过更加强大，并且可在施法后最多延迟5轮才引爆。爆炸造成每CL 1d6点火焰伤害 (最高20d6)。延迟爆裂火球所制造的炽热小球可以按照你的意愿立即引爆，或延迟至多5轮再引爆。你需要在施法完成时选择爆炸延迟的时间，而且除非有人触碰小球，否则一旦设定就不能更改。若你选择延迟引爆，炽热小球在引爆前会一直停留在指定地点。生物可以捡起小球当作投掷武器 (射程增量10尺)。如果有生物在引爆前一轮内持有并移动小球，则小球有25%的机率在被持有时爆炸。<\/p>",
