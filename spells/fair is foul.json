    "text": "<p>You curse the target with a disfiguring or painful mutation.<\/p><p>The target gains one random deformity from <b>Table: Arcane Malignancies<\/b> (below). The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled but can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell.<\/p><p>As changelings sense the awakening of the eerie powers they inherited from their hag progenitors, they are often mortified to discover terrifying and debilitating alterations to their physique. While the call seizes the changelings' minds around the time their bodies begin maturing, the arcane malignancies that mar their features and extremities have nothing to do with puberty.<\/p><p>Not every changeling develops a malignancy, and when a changeling does develop a malignancy, it is often unrelated to whatever traits her hag mother has. These transformations are more akin to a magical allergy, manifesting in response to the well of arcane energy bubbling away in the changeling's core.<\/p><p>A changeling character can take an arcane malignancy as a drawback in order to select an additional trait at character creation. Randomly determine the arcane malignancy by rolling a d% and consulting the table below.<\/p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">  <caption>   Table: Arcane Malignancies  <\/caption>  <thead>   <tr>    <th class=\"text\">d%<\/th>    <th class=\"text\">Effect<\/th>   <\/tr>  <\/thead>  <tbody>   <tr>    <td class=\"text\">1–2<\/td>    <td class=\"text\">The smallest three toes on each of your feet have fused together.

Casting or being the target of a spell you're allergic to causes you to break out in a painful rash. This rash deals 1d4 points of damage per spell level, and imposes a penalty on your Charisma equal to the level of the spell. The rash fades after a number of hours equal to the level of the spell.<\/td>   <\/tr>   <tr>    <td class=\"text\">68–69<\/td>    <td class=\"text\">The joints in your unnaturally long thumbs have fused, and you often fumble objects.

While they grant you no ability to breathe in water, they make it harder for you to catch your breath. When you are fatigued, it takes 12 hours of complete rest to recover. When you are exhausted, it takes 2 hours of complete rest to become fatigued.<\/td>   <\/tr>  <\/tbody> <\/table>",
