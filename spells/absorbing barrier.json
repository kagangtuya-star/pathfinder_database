The spell’s area of effect is often a sphere, although you can shape it to be smaller than the maximum area or to exclude certain adjacent areas or objects (for example, if you are warding a specific structure, or if you are roughly warding the front lines of a battlefield). This spell’s area is also up to 40 feet in height, so flying creatures benefit as long as they are in this area of effect.<br><br> Creatures and objects in the warded area gain damage reduction 20/magic against ranged weapons. Once the spell has prevented a total of 20 points of damage per caster level (maximum 200 points) to creatures and objects in the area, it is discharged.",
