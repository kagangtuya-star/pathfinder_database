    "mythicText": "Each mythic beast shape spell must be learned individually, and you must know the respective non-mythic beast shape spell to learn its mythic version. You don't have to learn them in order and are not required to know a lower-level mythic beast shape spell before you learn A higher-level one (for example, you can learn mythic beast shape II if you know beast shape II, even if you don't know mythic beast shape I). <br>Each mythic beast shape spell adds the following benefits to its respective non-mythic version. <br>The spell's bonuses to ability scores increase by 2, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, and the ability score penalties decrease by 2 (minimum penalty of 0). Choose one natural attack type the animal form has, such as bite or claws. The critical multiplier for this attack type increases by 1 (maximum ×4). <br><p style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><b>Augmented (2nd)<\/b>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. During each casting of the spell, a number of times equal to your tier, you can act as if you had the Natural Spell feat for 1 round. For example, if you're 2nd tier, you can use the Natural Spell feat for 2 rounds per casting of mythic beast shape. ",
