    "text": "<p>This spell functions as <i>interposing hand<\/i>, except that it can also grapple one opponent you select. The <i>grasping hand<\/i> gets one grapple attack per round. This attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Its CMB and CMD for grapple checks use your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +10 bonus for its Strength (31) score and a +1 bonus for being Large (its Dexterity is 10, granting no bonus on the Combat Maneuver Defense). The hand holds but does not harm creatures that it grapples. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action. The <i>grasping hand<\/i> can instead be directed to bull rush a target, using the same bonuses outlined above, or it can be directed to interpose itself, as <i>interposing hand<\/i> does.<\/p>",
    "name_zh": "擒拿掌",
    "text_zh": "<p>该法术的功能如同‘<a href=\"spell.html?spell=interposing hand\">护身掌 (interposing hand)<\/a>’一般，不过巨手还可以擒抱你选择的一个敌人。擒拿掌每轮可以获得一次擒抱攻击。此次攻击不会引起借机攻击。它在进行擒抱检定时，CMB与CMD使用你的CL来替代其BAB，力量属性 (31) 具有+10加值，并且由于大体型而获得+1加值 (它的敏捷为10, 在擒抱的战技防御中不会获得加值)。巨手可以抓住但不会伤害它擒抱的生物。将该法术指向新目标是移动动作。你也可以指定擒拿掌冲撞一个目标，冲撞时使用与上文中同样的加值，还可以像‘护身掌’一样将自己插入到适当的位置。<\/p>",
