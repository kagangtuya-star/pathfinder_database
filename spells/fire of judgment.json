At the start of its turn, the target takes 1d6 points of damage, and takes an additional 1d6 points of damage each time it attacks a creature other than you. If the creature is an outsider with the evil subtype, an evil-aligned dragon, or an undead creature this damage increases to 1d10. With a successful Saving Throw, a creature is affected by this spell for only 1 round. This damage is divine in nature and bypasses any DR the creature possesses.<\/p>",
