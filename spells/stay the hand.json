On a failed Saving Throw, the target does not follow through with its attack, and its entire action is wasted for the round. On a successful Saving Throw, the target can make its attack, forcing its strike though the compulsion but losing both accuracy and power, taking a -5 penalty on its attack and damage rolls. Whether or not the target makes its initial save or not, it is subject to a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls against the creature it originally targeted for the duration of the spell.<\/p>",
