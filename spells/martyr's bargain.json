The damage dealt by the spell and any related effects are then delayed for you (and you only) for a number of rounds equal to your caster level.<\/p><p>At the end of that time (or immediately if martyr's bargain is dispelled), the delayed damage takes effect on you as it would have at the time it was cast, but is maximized as if affected by the Maximize Spell metamagic feat. Spells and spell-like abilities that were already maximized gain no additional benefit from this spell. Nothing can prevent this delayed damage from affecting you.<\/p><p>You can be affected by only one martyr's bargain spell at a time. If you cast this spell while you are already under the effects of a previous martyr's bargain, the previous spell effect ends and you immediately take the damage it had delayed.<\/p>",
