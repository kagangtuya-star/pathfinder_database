You don't have to learn them in order, and aren't required to know a lower-level mythic elemental body spell before you learn A higher-level one (for example, you can learn mythic elemental body II if you know elemental body II, even if you don't know mythic elemental body I). <br>Each mythic elemental body spell adds the following benefits to its respective non-mythic version. <br>The spell's bonuses to ability scores increase by 2, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, and the ability score penalties 92 decrease by 2 (minimum penalty of 0). There is a 50% chance any critical hit or sneak attack against you is treated as a normal hit, as if you were wearing medium fortification armor. <br><p style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><b>Augmented (3rd)<\/b>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. You can also, a number of times equal to your tier, add half your tier to the DC of one spell you cast with an energy descriptor that matches your elemental type (air: electricity, earth: acid, fire: fire, water: cold).
