In fact, you speed up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still moving at their normal speeds. You are free to act for 1d4+1 rounds of apparent time. Normal and magical fire, cold, gas, and the like can still harm you. While the <i>time stop<\/i> is in effect, other creatures are invulnerable to your attacks and spells; you cannot target such creatures with any attack or spell. A spell that affects an area and has a duration longer than the remaining duration of the <i>time stop<\/i> have their normal effects on other creatures once the <i>time stop<\/i> ends. Most spellcasters use the additional time to improve their defenses, summon allies, or flee from combat.<\/p><p>You cannot move or harm items held, carried, or worn by a creature stuck in normal time, but you can affect any item that is not in another creature's possession.<\/p><p>You are undetectable while <i>time stop<\/i> lasts.
