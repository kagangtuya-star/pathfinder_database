Additionally, you can attempt a Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 11 + the caster level of the compulsion against each magical compulsion currently affecting the target that could be detected by detect magic. If successful, you can identify the specific spell affecting the target. You gain a +4 bonus on your Spellcraft check if the effect is confusion, insanity, or a similar effect that explicitly causes madness or insanity.<\/p><p>If you successfully identify such an effect with sense madness, the insights provided by this spell grant you a +1 circumstance bonus on your next caster level check in the following 1 minute made to counter, dispel, or remove that specific effect. After attempting a check to identify a madness, addiction, or compulsion, you can't attempt that check against the same creature again, even if you concentrate on the creature again.<\/p>",
