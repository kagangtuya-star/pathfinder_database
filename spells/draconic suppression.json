For example, an ancient green dragon would revert to the special abilities of a very old dragon and lose access to its miasma ability and its dominate person spell-like ability. This spell has no effect on a dragon's armor class, feats, frightful presence, hit points, physical attacks, saving throws, senses, size, skills, spellcasting, or statistics.<\/p>",
