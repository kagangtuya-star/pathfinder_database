If your alignment includes multiple alignment components, such as lawful good, you select one alignment component to impart to the target. Whenever the target confirms a critical hit against or takes damage from a creature, that creature must attempt a Will save. On a failed save, the creature is sent to the Outer Plane matching your alignment, as per <i>plane shift<\/i>, and the spell ends. A warpriest treats this spell as a 6th-level cleric spell for the purposes of preparing the spell, determining DCs, and so forth.",
