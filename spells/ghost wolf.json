    "text": "<p>This spell conjures a Large, quasi-real, wolflike creature made of roiling black smoke. It functions as phantom steed, except as noted above. In addition, the creature radiates an aura of fear. Any creature with fewer than 6 Hit Dice within 30 feet (except the ghost wolf‘s rider) must make a Will save or become shaken for 1d4 rounds (this is a mind-affecting fear effect). A creature that makes its Will save is unaffected by the steed's fear aura for 24 hours.<\/p><p>The ghost wolf may also be used in combat. Once per round, the rider may direct the ghost wolf to attack in battle as a free action (bite +10, 1d8+6 points of damage); unlike an animal mount, this does not require a Ride check or any training. Once the ghost wolf attacks, it lasts for only 1 round per level thereafter.<\/p><p>The mount is AC 18 (–1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex) and 7 Hit Points + 1 hit point per Caster Level. If it loses all its Hit Points, the ghost wolf disappears. A ghost wolf has a speed of 20 feet per two caster levels, to a maximum of 100 feet at 10th level. It can bear its rider's weight plus up to 10 pounds per Caster Level.<\/p><p>These mounts gain certain powers according to Caster Level. A mount's abilities include those of mounts of lower caster levels.<\/p><p><i>8th Level<\/i>: The mount can ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in speed.<\/p><p><i>10th Level<\/i>: The mount can use <i>water walk <\/i>at will (as the spell, no Action required to activate this ability).<\/p><p><i>12th Level<\/i>: The mount can use <i>air walk <\/i>at will (as the spell, no Action required to activate this ability) for up to 1 round at a time, after which it falls to the ground.<\/p><p><i>14th Level<\/i>: The mount can fly at its speed with a bonus on Fly Skill Checks equal to your Caster Level.<\/p>",
