If you’re brought below 0 hit points or killed (including by effects that kill without dealing damage, such as phantasmal killer and power word kill), the eruption of healing energy acts as mass cure light wounds on allies (other than you). Allies with the fewest Hit Dice are affected first. Among allies with equal HD, those closest to you are affected first. If the duration ends, the stored healing energy dissipates with no effect.<\/p>",
