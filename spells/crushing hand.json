Its CMB and CMD for grapple checks use your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +12 bonus for its Strength score (35) and a +1 bonus for being Large (its Dexterity is 10, granting no bonus to the CMD). A <i>crushing hand<\/i> deals 2d6+12 points of damage on each successful grapple check against an opponent. The <i>crushing hand<\/i> can instead be directed to bull rush a target (as forceful hand), using the same bonuses outlined above, or it can be directed to interpose itself, as interposing hand does.<\/p><\/div>",
