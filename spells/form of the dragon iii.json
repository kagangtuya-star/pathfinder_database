    "text": "<p>This spell functions as <i>form of the dragon II<\/i> save that it also allows you to take the form of a Huge chromatic or metallic dragon. You gain the following abilities: a +10 size bonus to Strength, a +8 size bonus to Constitution, a +8 natural armor bonus, fly 120 feet (poor), blindsense 60 feet, darkvision 120 feet, a breath weapon, damage reduction 10/magic, frightful presence (DC equal to the DC for this spell), and immunity to one element (of the same type <i>form of the dragon I<\/i> grants resistance to). You also gain one bite (2d8), two claws (2d6), two wing attacks (1d8), and one tail slap attack (2d6). You can use the breath weapon as often as you like, but you must wait 1d4 rounds between uses. All breath weapons deal 12d8 points of damage and allow a Reflex save for half damage. Line breath weapons increase to 100-foot lines and cones increase to 50-foot cones.<\/p><\/div>",
    "mythicText": "Each <i>mythic form of the dragon<\/i> spell must be learned individually, and you must know the respective non-mythic <i>form of the dragon spell<\/i> to learn its mythic version. You don't have to learn them in order, and aren't required to know a lower-level <i>mythic form of the dragon<\/i> spell before you learn a higher-level one (for example, you can learn <i>mythic form of the dragon II<\/i> if you know <i>form of the dragon II<\/i>, even if you don't know <i>mythic form of the dragon I<\/i>). Each <i>mythic form of the dragon<\/i> spell adds the following benefits to its respective non-mythic version. <br>The spell's bonuses to ability scores increase by 2, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, and the breath weapon damage increases by 2d8. All of the dragon form's natural attacks increase by one step (see Improved Natural Attack on page 315 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary). ",
