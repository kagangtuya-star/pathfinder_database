    "text": "You fill the target’s mind with childlike wonder, allowing that creature to marvel at things that would be debilitating to others. Penalties that the target would take as a result of an emotion effect are instead treated as morale bonuses equal to half the penalty’s value (for example, if the target were affected by a <i>crushing despair<\/i> spell, she would gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls, instead of the spell’s normal effect). Furthermore, morale bonuses she gains from other sources are increased by 1. Finally, the target gains a +2 bonus on saving throws to resist spells of the pattern subschool, as her childlike wonder allows her to marvel at the beauty of such effects without being overwhelmed by them.",
