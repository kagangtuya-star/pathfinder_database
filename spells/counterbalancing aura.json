This benefit applies against all attacks and effects, not just attacks by neutral creatures.<\/p><p>Second, a warded creature gains spell resistance 23 against spells cast by chaotic neutral, lawful neutral, neutral evil, and neutral good creatures, and spell resistance 27 against spells cast by neutral creatures with no other alignment components.<\/p><p>Third, the spell protects warded creatures from possession and influence by such creatures (otherwise as protection from evil).<\/p><p>Finally, if a chaotic neutral, lawful neutral, neutral evil, or neutral good creature successfully hits a warded creature with a melee attack, the attacker is sickened for 1d6 rounds (Fort negates).
