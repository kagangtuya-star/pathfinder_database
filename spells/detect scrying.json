You know the location of every magical sensor within the spell's area.<br><br>If the scrying attempt originates within the area, you also know its location; otherwise, you and the scrier immediately make opposed caster level checks (1d20 + caster level). If you at least match the scrier's result, you get a visual image of the scrier and an accurate sense of his direction and distance from you.",

If it’s using a non-mythic means of scrying, you also gain an accurate sense of its direction and distance from you. You automatically succeed at caster level checks to overcome <i>nondetection<\/i> or similar effects (other than <i>mind blank<\/i>) that block your ability to detect the creature.<br><br>If you learn the creature’s direction and distance with this spell, you can, as an immediate action, cast a mind-affecting spell through the scrying sensor to target the creature. This spell affects only the scrying creature, even if the spell normally affects an area or multiple targets. You must expend a number of uses of mythic power equal to the level of the spell you wish to cast against the creature.<br><br><b>Augmented (6th)<\/b>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, even <i>mind blank<\/i> doesn’t prevent you from detecting the scrying creature. If you teleport to the creature’s location within 1 minute, you arrive on target (with no chance of error) and bypass non-mythic effects that block teleportation. Alternatively, you can compel the creature to attempt to teleport to you within 1 minute (Will negates, DC equal to 10 plus double your tier). It must use its own means of teleportation to do so, but you guarantee it arrives on target and bypasses non-mythic effects that block teleportation to your location.",
