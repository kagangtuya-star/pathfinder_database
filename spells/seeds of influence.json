You can target that creature with mind-affecting spells of a spell level lower than seeds of influence as if those spells were modified by Enlarge Spell (the modified spell doesn't take longer to cast and doesn't use a higher-level spell slot). Whenever the target succeeds at a saving throw against a divination or mind-affecting spell you cast, seeds of influence ends for that target. A creature can be subject to only one seeds of influence spell at a time; later castings of seeds of influence remove any previous casting.<\/p>",
