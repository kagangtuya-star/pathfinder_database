If you cannot think of any sinful actions you performed the previous day, you are unable to complete the ritual. Once your meditation is complete, draw the rune corresponding to the chosen sin in a prominent place on your body, such as the palm, the back of the hand, the forehead, or the chest. Choose a school of magic from the following list: abjuration, conjuration, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, or transmutation. Once you choose a school of magic, it cannot be changed. You gain a +2 bonus on saves against spells of the chosen school.<br /><br /><strong>Boons<br /></strong>1: explosive runes; <br />2: symbol of stunning; <br />3: symbol of vulnerability.</p>"

You can apply this insight to empower your magical effects.</em><br /><br /><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br />Int 13, Spell Focus (divination), Spellcraft 3 ranks.<br /><br /><strong>Benefits</strong><br />Immediately before casting a spell, as a swift action, you can attempt to augment a spell's casting using Arithmancy. To do so, determine the digital root of the name of the spell you are casting.<br />To find the digital root of a spell name, first assign a numerical value to each letter of the name, per the Letter Values table. Once you have a string of digits, sum them.</p>\n<table class=\"inner\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Numerical Value</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Associated Letters</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>a, j, s</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>b, k, t</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>c, l, u</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>d, m, v</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>e, n, w</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>f, o, x</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>g, p, y</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>h, q, z</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>i, r</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />If the result has more than one digit, sum those digits. Repeat this process until you arrive at a single number, called the digital root.<br />Once you've translated the name of the spell into a single digital root, attempt a Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell level + the digital root. If your check succeeds, the spell is cast at +1 caster level. If your check fails, the spell is cast at -1 caster level. If you do not cast the spell you intended to augment with arithmancy, the spell is expended with no effect, though you retain the action you would have spent to cast it. Metamagic effects are not included in a spell's name when determining the spell's digital root, but they increase the spell's level as normal when determining the DC of the Spellcraft check.</p>\n<p><br />You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to the number of caster levels you possess.</p>\n<p><br />For example, Ezren wants to use Arithmancy to cast an augmented fireball. First, he translates the spell name into numbers. Fireball translates to 6, 9, 9, 5, 2, 1, 3, 3. Then he calculates the digital root. In this case, 6 + 9 + 9 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 38, 3 + 8 = 11, and 1 + 1 = 2. Therefore, the digital root of fireball is 2. He then attempts a Spellcraft check against a DC of 15 (10 + 3 [fireball's spell level] + 2 [fireball's digital root]). If his check succeeds, he can cast the fireball this round at +1 caster level. If he fails, he can cast the spell at -1 caster level this round. He may also choose not to cast fireball and perform another action, though he expends the spell.</p>"

Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new armor trick option.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>The trick 'Protected Limbs' is not legal for Pathfinder Society </em></p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>Heavy Armor Tricks</strong></h2>\n<p>These armor tricks are most common among the various Hellknight orders, though their secrets have spread to other organizations and fighter schools. Such armor tricks utilize the mass and heft of heavy armor, and don&rsquo;t function when you&rsquo;re wearing heavy armor that uses magic or materials to be treated as medium armor for any purpose, unless the heavy armor trick says otherwise.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Blade among the Folds (Sleight of Hand 3 ranks)</strong></p>\n<p>You are adept at concealing small weapons in your armor. While wearing heavy armor, you gain a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to conceal a light melee weapon or an easily concealed ranged weapon, such as a dart, sling, or hand crossbow, within your armor. In addition, a searcher doesn&rsquo;t gain the usual +4 bonus on Perception checks to find the hidden weapon as long as you are wearing your armor, even if the searcher frisks you. This trick functions even in heavy armor that uses magic or materials to be treated as medium armor.</p>\n<p><strong>Protected Limbs (Combat Expertise)</strong></p>\n<p>Whenever you attempt a disarm, grapple, sunder, or trip combat maneuver check, you gain a +4 bonus to your AC against any attack of opportunity you provoke as a result of attempting the combat maneuver check, and to your CMD against any combat maneuver your foe attempts against you before the beginning of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Shrug It Off (Great Fortitude)</strong></p>\n<p>Once per day as an immediate action, when you are hit by a confirmed critical hit or sneak attack, you can direct the blow to the thickest section of your armor to lessen the damage dealt. This reduces the attack to dealing its minimum damage, though it remains a successful critical hit or sneak attack (the minimum damage calculated includes all additional dice for the critical hit or sneak attack, and any abilities that apply due to it being a critical hit or sneak attack function normally). You can use this ability a second time each day when your base attack bonus reaches +4, and an additional time per day for every 4 points of bonus you accrue thereafter.</p>\n<p><strong>Steel-Plated Smasher (Power Attack)</strong></p>\n<p>You gain a bonus equal to 1/4 of your armor&rsquo;s armor check penalty (not including any reduction to the armor check penalty from class features or feats) on Strength checks to break doors and objects with less hardness than your armor. When your base attack bonus reaches +8, this bonus increases to 1/2 your armor&rsquo;s armor check penalty. When your base attack bonus reaches +16, this bonus increases to equal your armor&rsquo;s full armor check penalty.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>PFS Legal Light Armor Tricks</h2>\n<p>Light armor tricks are rarely taught in formal schools, though some can be learned from experienced Freemen on the streets of Kaer Maga or the leaders of the Bloody Barbers thieves&rsquo; guild in Absalom. These armor tricks are often used to supplement the modest defense provided by lighter armors by maximizing flexibility and mobility.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Combat Acrobatics (Int 13, Combat Expertise, Acrobatics 3 ranks)</strong></p>\n<p>You have trained yourself to expose only armored sections of your body when performing flips and rolls, leaving you less distracted by concerns about being struck in combat. You are not considered flat-footed when using Acrobatics to move on narrow surfaces and uneven ground without falling, and do not lose your Dexterity bonus to AC while doing so. Additionally, if you use Combat Expertise to increase your AC, the DC for you to use Acrobatics to move through a threatened square at full speed without provoking an attack of opportunity by 10 does not increase.</p>\n<p><strong>Reactive Mobility (Mobility, Nimble Moves)</strong></p>\n<p>Practice has honed your reactions so that you react quickly and instinctively to threats. You add your dodge bonus granted by Mobility to your AC against all attacks of opportunity that you provoke, not just against those that are caused when you move out of or within a threatened area.</p>\n<p>Reflexive Mobility (Combat Reflexes, Mobility): You have learned to sacrifice an opportunity to wound an opponent in order to avoid being wounded yourself. When you provoke an attack of opportunity from an opponent, you can expend one of your own potential attacks of opportunity for that round to double the bonus to your AC that you gain from the Mobility feat against that attack. This benefit applies to all attacks of opportunity that you provoke with the same action. If you are unable to take any more attacks of opportunity this turn, you cannot use this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Sliding Charge (Improved Trip, base attack bonus +4)</strong></p>\n<p>You can use your momentum to confound your opponents. Whenever you charge an opponent and attempt a trip combat maneuver check against that opponent as a melee attack, you can drop to the ground as a swift action in order to slide into your target. When doing so, you add your Dexterity bonus (up to your armor&rsquo;s maximum Dexterity bonus) to the combat maneuver check. Whether or not you succeed at the check, you are prone at the end of your charge.</p>\n<h2>PFS Legal Medium Armor Tricks</h2>\n<p>Many of these armor tricks originated in Andoran and are employed by various branches of the Eagle Knights, who highly value the greater protection provided by medium armor but want to retain f lexibility and agility in combat. Armor Focus, which is a prerequisite for two of these tricks, can be found on page 16.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Acrobatic Sit-Up (Mobility, Acrobatics 5 ranks)</strong></p>\n<p>You have developed the ability to recover from a fall and attack an opponent in a single fluid movement. Whenever you are prone, you can make an attack against a single foe and stand from prone without provoking an attack of opportunity from that foe. Make a single melee attack against one target without the normal penalties for attacking while prone. If you hit your target, you can immediately stand from prone (normally a move action) without provoking an attack of opportunity from that target for doing so. Any other target that threatens you can still make an attack of opportunity against you. If your attack fails, you provoke attacks of opportunity from all threatening foes and cannot stand until your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Heavy Versatility (Armor Focus, Armor Trick [Heavy Armor])</strong></p>\n<p>You take advantage of all the defensive capabilities your armor can offer. You can treat medium armor as heavy armor for the purpose of which armor tricks you can perform in it.</p>\n<p><strong>Light Versatility (Armor Focus, Armor Trick [Light Armor])</strong></p>\n<p>You are so comfortable in your armor that it seems lighter than it is. You can treat medium armor as light armor for the purpose of what armor tricks you can perform in it.</p>\n<p><strong>Roll into the Blow (Mobility)</strong></p>\n<p>You keep your wits about you when attacked and can turn the situation to your advantage. Once per day when you are hit by an attack of opportunity, you can lunge toward your attacker, throwing it off-balance. The attacker takes a &ndash;4 penalty on all melee attack rolls until the beginning of its next turn. You can use this ability a second time each day when your base attack bonus reaches +4, and an additional time per day for every 4 points of bonus you accrue thereafter.</p>\n<p><strong>Versatile Armor (Combat Expertise)</strong></p>\n<p>You can adjust how you present yourself and maneuver in your armor to maximize your speed and mobility or to maximize your defenses. While using your armor for speed, your movement is not affected by your armor and its armor check penalty and armor bonus to AC both decrease by 2. While using your armor for defense, your armor&rsquo;s check penalty increases by 3 and its armor bonus to AC increases by 1. Adjusting how you use your armor is a move action, and the adjustment remains until you change it, take off your armor, or lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Combat Trick (from the Combat Stamina feat)</strong></p>\n<p>You can spend 5 stamina points to use an armor trick while wearing armor with which you are not proficient, or without meeting the trick&rsquo;s additional prerequisites.

The GM may rule that some items are too obviously valuable or worthless for this feat to apply (a king wouldn't trade his crown for any item, and no normal person would trade an item for a piece of garbage). If you fail the check by 5 or more, the target is insulted and his attitude toward you worsens by one category.<br /><br />Once the exchange happens, make an Appraise roll opposed by the target's Appraise or Sense Motive roll. If the target wins, it immediately realizes the true value of the object you offered it and behaves accordingly. If you succeed, it believes your false assessment for 1 round; for every 5 by which your check exceeds your opponent's check, the deception lasts 1 more round. As with disbelieving illusions, the target's ally can point out the true value of the object, giving the target another check with a +2 bonus.<br /><br />You cannot use this ability in combat, against a creature whose attitude toward you is hostile or unfriendly, against a creature that does not understand you, or against a creature that has an Intelligence score of 3 or less.</p>"

The figurine has the standard abilities of a familiar or animal companion of its type, plus additional abilities related to its figurine type (see below). The main advantage of this is that if your familiar or companion is killed in creature form, it merely reverts to statue form and can be used again later. The following standard figurines are available as animal companions (C) or familiars (F).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Ebony Fly (C)</strong><br />You must have the Vermin Heart feat (see page 219 of the Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting) to select this creature as an animal companion. It is treated as a horse animal companion, and at 8th level it gains a fly speed of 120 feet (average maneuverability).<br /><br /><strong>Golden Lions (C)</strong><br />When you select a golden lion as an animal companion, one of the pair becomes your companion and the other retains its standard figurine abilities.<br /><br /><strong>Ivory Goats (C)</strong><br />When selecting an ivory goat as an animal companion, you select one of the three goats in the set (traveling, travail, or terror) as your companion; the others remain standard figurines. All three goats are treated as horse companions. The goat of traveling never suffers from fatigue or exhaustion from extended travel. The goat of travail has 2 horn attacks (1d8 + Str bonus) in addition to a horse's normal attacks. The goat of terror has the fear aura and magical weapon horns as described in its figurine entry.<br /><br /><strong>Marble Elephant (C)</strong><br />The elephant is treated as an elephant companion (see page 128 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary).<br /><br /><strong>Serpentine Owl (C, F)</strong><br />The owl is treated as a bird animal companion or an owl familiar, but only in its Small horned owl form. In its giant owl form, it is merely a creature, not an animal companion or familiar. After three uses of its giant owl form, the figurine loses that transformation ability forever but still functions normally in its horned owl form as an animal companion or familiar.<br /><br /><strong>Silver Raven (C, F)</strong><br />The raven is treated as a bird animal companion or a raven familiar. It retains its metallic appearance and animal messenger ability (though this is redundant for an intelligent familiar) but not its hardness when in animal form.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While the figurine is active, you and the active figurine gain all the normal benefits of having a companion creature; for example, a wizard with a silver raven familiar gains a +3 bonus on Appraise checks, the raven can speak one language, and so on. While the figure is inactive, you gain none of these benefits but are not otherwise hampered by its inert state (as if the creature were out of range but not dead). The usable duration of the companion figurine doubles; for example, an ebony fly is normally usable up to three times per week for up to 12 hours per use, but as a companion creature you may use it up to six times per week for up to 12 hours per use. The figurine is still a magic item and is subject to effects like antimagic field and dispel magic that affect magic items; it uses its caster level or your own, whichever is greater.</p>"

The attempt to hide the spell slows your casting slightly, such that spells that normally take a standard action to cast now take a full-round action, and spells that normally take longer than a standard action take twice as long. (Swift action spells still take a swift action.) To discover your ruse, a creature must succeed at a Perception, Sense Motive, or Spellcraft check (the creature receives an automatic check with whichever of those skills has the highest bonus) against a DC equal to 15 + your number of ranks in Bluff or Disguise (whichever is higher) + your Charisma modifier; the creature gains a bonus on its check equal to the level of the spell or spelllike ability you are concealing.<br/><br/> If your spell has a somatic component, any creature that can see you receives a Perception or Spellcraft check (whichever has the highest bonus) against a DC equal to 15 + your number of ranks in Sleight of Hand + your Dexterity modifier; the creature gains a bonus on its check equal to the level of the spell or spell-like ability you are concealing. Since you are concealing the spell's manifestation through other actions, others observing you realize you're doing something, even if they don't realize you're casting a spell. If there is a verbal component, they still hear your loud, clear voice but don't notice the spell woven within. If an opponent fails its check, your casting also does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and an opponent that fails its check can't use readied actions that depend on realizing that you're casting a spell or using a spell-like ability, or readied actions such as counterspelling that require identifying the spell you're casting. Spells such as fireball that create an additional obvious effect (aside from the manifestation of casting that all spells and spell-like abilities share) still create that effect, though it might not be obvious who cast the spell unless it emanates from you.<br/><br/> If a character interacts with you long enough to attempt a Sense Motive check without realizing you have been casting spells, that character can use Sense Motive to gain a hunch that you're behaving unusually."

You must still succeed at the appropriate DC check, and the work takes the same amount of time as a normal item. If you fail the Craft check by 5 or more, you ruin all the raw materials and must begin again.

If you fail the Craft check by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and must pay half the original raw material cost again. </p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Shoddy Item</strong><br /><strong>Price</strong> varies; <strong>Weight</strong> varies<br />A shoddy item is any mundane piece of equipment that has been cleverly but poorly crafted such that its materials and workmanship are worse than expected, but the flaws are concealed. Layers of material are thinner than normal, hasps and hinges are only loosely attached, metals are mixed improperly, resulting in softer alloys, and so forth. Shoddy items are sold for the same price as their well-made counterparts. Manufacturing a shoddy item requires the Craft Shoddy Item feat (see above) in order to successfully conceal the poor workmanship. Shoddy items are never masterwork or made of special materials (though they might appear to be made of a special material), and single-use items can never be made as shoddy items.<br />Any shoddy item has its hardness reduced by 2 and its hit points reduced by half. <br />Any weapon or piece of armor constructed in a shoddy manner takes damage each time it is used; a weapon takes the same amount of damage it deals in an attack (minus its lower hardness rating), and a piece of armor takes damage identical to its wearer's loss in hit points from an enemy's successful attack (again, after taking the adjusted hardness into account). Items other than weapons and armor have a 10% chance to gain the broken condition with each day of use, and if they have a limited number of uses, they have half as many uses as normal. In either case, shoddy items that gain the broken condition can never have that condition removed (even by using magic or if they later recover hit points) without further successful Craft checks and gp expenditure to fix the initial flaws. Shoddy items that are destroyed cannot be recovered by any means, and are useless for anything more than salvaging some of the raw materials. A shoddy item typically costs the same as a normal item of its kind.<br /><br />A character who succeeds at a DC 15 Appraise (or appropriate Craft) check notices the shoddy condition of an item, but the character must specifically inspect the item to do so.</p>"

The pain from this probing stimulates your powers of focus, granting you a bonus of +1d6 on any concentration check you must attempt as part of casting that spell.

If you don&rsquo;t have the Vital Strike feat, that attack deals 1 additional point of damage instead. The first time you make an attack of opportunity with a greatsword after using Vital Strike with a greatsword on your turn, you can apply Vital Strike to that attack of opportunity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Prerequisites</strong><br />Str 13, Cleave, Power Attack, Vital Strike, base attack bonus +10.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Optional Replacement</strong><br />A chaotic neutral barbarian or fighter of at least 10th level who worships Gorum can replace a bonus feat or rage power with the following advanced benefit, even if she doesn&rsquo;t meet the prerequisites.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Benefit</strong><br />When you use Vital Strike, Improved Vital Strike, or Greater Vital Strike with a greatsword, the damage counts as continuous damage from an injury for the purpose of determining whether a target must attempt a concentration check to cast spells (Core Rulebook 206).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Iomedae's Inspiring Sword</p>\n<p>The initial benefit of Iomedae's Inspiring Sword only functions during combat.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Iomedae demonstrates how to turn a longsword into a shining beacon of hope.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Optional Replacement</strong><br />A paladin who worships Iomedae can replace a mercy with this initial benefit, even if she doesn&rsquo;t meets its prerequisites.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Initial Benefit</strong><br />While wielding a longsword, you can perform an impressive display of prowess as a full-round action. All allies within 30 feet who can see your display gain a +2 sacred bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 round + 1 round per 5 points of base attack bonus you have.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Prerequisites</strong><br />Dazzling Display, Weapon Focus (longsword), base attack bonus +10.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Optional Replacement</strong><br />A paladin of at least 9th level who worships Iomedae can replace a mercy with the following advanced benefit, even if she doesn&rsquo;t meet the benefit&rsquo;s prerequisites.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Benefit</strong><br />As a standard action or at the end of a charge, you can make an attack against a foe with a longsword. If you succeed, you grant all allies who can see your attack a +2 sacred bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 minute.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Irori&rsquo;s Perfected Fist</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Practically synonymous with Irori and his faith, The Woven Fist is among the best known of all diving fighting manuals. Many learned monks were taught their first martial techniques using drills and regiments from this manual, which some claim was written by Irori&rsquo;s own hand before his ascension to divinity. Although most commonly found in temples to Irori and secluded monasteries, copies of The Woven Fist often make their way into less scrupulous hands because of their effectiveness.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Optional Replacement</strong><br />A lawful neutral brawler or monk can replace a bonus feat with the following initial benefit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Initial Benefit</strong><br />You can take a &ndash;2 penalty on all attack rolls made with your unarmed strikes in order to deal the average amount of damage with each successful attack instead of rolling your weapon damage. For instance, if your unarmed strike would normally deal 1d4 points of weapon damage, you instead deal 2 points of weapon damage. Apply bonuses and modifiers to this result as if you had rolled your damage normally. You must choose to use this benefit before making an attack roll, and its effects last until your next turn. You do not average additional damage dice (such as those granted by a sneak attack) when using this ability.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Prerequisites</strong><br />Critical Focus; Divine Fighting Technique; Weapon Focus (unarmed strike); base attack bonus +10 or monk level 10th.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Optional Replacement</strong><br />A lawful neutral brawler or monk of at least 10th level who worships Irori and has the Divine Fighting Technique feat can replace a bonus feat with the following advanced benefit without meeting its prerequisites.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Benefit</strong><br />You no longer take a &ndash;2 penalty on attack rolls with your unarmed strikes when you choose to deal the average amount of damage. If you critically hit a creature when using this ability, you automatically inflict maximum weapon damage for that critical hit (although you must still roll sneak attack dice or any other dicebased additional damage).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Lamashtu's Carving</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the grisliest divine fighting manuals is Fecundity of Corpses, a harrowing tome that depicts the fighting styles favored by the followers of Lamashtu, the Mother of Monsters. In addition to detailing many of the more gruesome rites favored by the Demon Queen, Fecundity of Corpses includes hundreds of techniques recorded in blood by cultists of Lamashtu from across the Inner Sea region. Though no standardized edition of this manual exists because of the cult&rsquo;s discordant hierarchy, each tome manages to perfectly capture similar techniques for sowing fear and blood in Lamashtu&rsquo;s name.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Initial Benefit</strong><br />As a standard action, you can make a single attack with a falchion or a kukri in order to deal bleed damage to the target. When you make this attack, you do not apply your ability modifier (normally Strength, but potentially other modifiers) to the hit point damage dealt by your attack&mdash;instead, add an amount of bleed damage equal to this modifier. The bleeding can be stopped by a successful DC 15 Heal check or any amount of magical healing. Bleed damage from this benefit doesn&rsquo;t stack with itself.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Prerequisites</strong><br />Str 13, Dazing AssaultAPG, Divine Fighting Technique, Power Attack.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Benefit</strong><br />Whenever you hit a bleeding creature with a melee attack using a falchion or a kukri, that creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + your base attack bonus) or become staggered for 1 round. Multiple attacks do not cause this condition to stack, and a creature that successfully saves against this staggering effect is immune to this effect for 1 round.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Norgorber&rsquo;s Silent Shiv</strong><br />The advanced benefit is not legal for play&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Entombed within a volume known as The Reaper&rsquo;s Hand, the divine fighting techniques of Norgorber are among the most elusive in the Inner Sea region, but are theorized to cover the techniques that acolytes of Father Skinsaw use to move and strike unseen. Copies of this manual are rare, and those who spill its secrets to anyone unworthy often meet a swift and bloody end at the hands of the faith&rsquo;s inquisitors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Optional Replacement</strong><br />A neutral evil rogue of at least 2nd level who worships Norgorber can replace a rogue talent with the following initial benefit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Initial Benefit</strong><br />Whenever you attack an opponent that is completely unaware of your presence (such as when you are using the Stealth skill or invisible), your attack deals damage as if you were one size category larger. This benefit applies only to the first attack that you make against the target, and only with attacks made with light or one-handed weapons intended for creatures of your size (including thrown attacks).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Prerequisites</strong><br />Divine Fighting Technique, Stealth 10 ranks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Optional Replacement</strong><br />A neutral evil rogue of at least 10th level who worships Norgorber can replace an advanced rogue talent with the following advanced benefit without meeting its prerequisites.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Benefit</strong><br />At the start of each round, choose one opponent that you can see and attempt a Stealth check as a swift action. If the result of your check exceeds the target&rsquo;s CMD, treat the target as if it were completely unaware of your presence for the purpose of the initial benefit of this divine fighting technique. If you beat the target&rsquo;s CMD by 5 or more, you also treat it as being completely unaware of your presence for the purposes of all class features and feats you have.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Rovagug&rsquo;s Thunder</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Most copies of Ravage and Ruin, the divine fighting manual of the Rough Beast Rovagug, are scrawled in blood upon flensed skins by orc priests&mdash;and indeed the vile techniques described within originated from the Hold of Belkzen not long after the orcs first seized that land as their own. Reviled across the Inner Sea, Ravage and Ruin sees additional use among savage Ulfen clans who have fallen to the Rough Beast&rsquo;s urges to become corrupt, lunatic cannibals who relish despoiling beauty in Rovagug&rsquo;s name.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Initial Benefit</strong><br />Whenever you succeed at a dirty trickAPG combat maneuver check against an opponent, you deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier. In addition, whenever your dirty trick combat maneuver check beats an opponent&rsquo;s CMD by 5 or more, you can forgo increasing the duration of your condition by 1 or more rounds to instead impose a &ndash;2 penalty on all of that opponent&rsquo;s Charisma-based checks. This penalty doesn&rsquo;t stack with itself, and it lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 minute) or until the target receives any form of magical healing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Prerequisites</strong><br />Power Attack, Divine Fighting Technique, base attack bonus +10.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Optional Replacement</strong><br />A chaotic evil barbarian of at least 10th level who worships Rovagug can replace a rage power with the following advanced benefit without meeting its prerequisites.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Benefit</strong><br />Anytime you use Power Attack with a great axe or a natural attack, you ignore an amount of the target&rsquo;s hardness or damage reduction equal to the penalty Power Attack imparts to your attack roll. This benefit stacks with Penetrating Strike and Greater Penetrating Strike.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Sarenrae's Mercy</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Although the Dawnflower is the goddess of healing and redemption, she is not a goddess of peace, and her followers are taught that combat may be the only way to ensure the safety of those who look to the faith for protection. In such situations, the faithful of Sarenrae are expected to end combat swiftly and efficiently, to avoid drawing out the pain and agony of battle. When one can end a battle without resorting to killing, the opportunity for redemption of the defeated foe still remains. The pages of Dawnflower&rsquo;s Mercies teach methods by which those who serve Sarenrae as soldiers can vanquish enemies in combat without killing them, and encourage those who follow the teachings held within to offer those they take prisoner the chance to be welcomed into Sarenrae&rsquo;s arms.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Initial Benefit</strong><br />You take no penalty on attack rolls for using a scimitar to deal nonlethal damage. If your attack with the scimitar would normally deal additional damage (such as via sneak attack, the flaming weapon special ability, or the like), this additional damage can be nonlethal damage. You can also alter spells with the fire, good, or light descriptor and inflict spells so that the damage they deal is nonlethal damage instead. You can choose to apply this effect as the spell is cast.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Prerequisites</strong><br />Great Fortitude, Weapon Focus (scimitar), Heal 10 ranks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Benefit</strong><br />Once per round as you strike a foe with a weapon and deal nonlethal damage with that attack, you regain 1d6 hit points as the warmth of Sarenrae&rsquo;s approval and the conviction that you are doing the right thing to minimize suffering infuses your body and soul. If the attack that dealt nonlethal damage was from a scimitar, you instead regain 2d6 hit points. You can gain the benefit of this healing only once per round, regardless of how many successful attacks you make with the weapon.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Torag's Patient Strikes</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Copies of Lessons of the Father, the divine fighting manual of Torag, are somewhat rare outside of the Five Kings Mountains, as tradition mandates that all copies of Lessons of the Father must be scribed by hand in Dwarven on iron sheets and bound between slabs of stone hand-carved by a cleric of Torag. As a result, these tomes are somewhat cumbersome to transport (even the smallest copy of the book weighs 50 pounds, and most exceed 100 pounds in weight). Those who have mastered the Lessons of the Father are highly respected within the faith.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Initial Benefit</strong><br />Whenever you wield a warhammer, add your Wisdom bonus to the total number of attacks of opportunity that you can make per round. These additional attacks of opportunity don&rsquo;t stack with those granted by Combat Reflexes, but this benefit counts as Combat Reflexes for the purpose of satisfying feat prerequisites and prestige class requirements. In addition, you can make attacks of opportunity while you&rsquo;re flat-footed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Prerequisites</strong><br />Divine Fighting Technique, Vital Strike, Weapon Focus (warhammer), base attack bonus +10.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Benefit</strong><br />Once per round, before you make an attack of opportunity with a warhammer, you can declare an opportunistic strike. If the attack hits, you can apply the effects of your Vital Strike feat. You can apply the Improved Vital Strike or Greater Vital Strike feat instead if you have either of those feats. If you confirm a critical hit with an opportunistic strike, you can attempt a disarm or trip combat maneuver check against the target as a free action&mdash;this combat maneuver does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Urgathoa's Hunger</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The grisly content of Pallid Cravings can be found in many places where the Pallid Princess maintains a significant presence, especially within the undead nation of Geb. The pages of this manuscript are said to be tattooed onto a humanoid and flensed off while the victim is still alive; the swaths of skin are then carefully preserved for presentation in the book. Pallid Cravings details hundreds of ways for a member of Urgathoa&rsquo;s faithful to satisfy her depraved urges for an opponent&rsquo;s flesh and blood while in battle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Initial Benefit</strong><br />A number of times per day equal to your Wisdom bonus, you can feast upon the life essence of a creature that you hit with a scythe. Activating this ability is a swift action. When you do so, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the damage you dealt with the scythe attack. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute and don&rsquo;t stack.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Prerequisites</strong><br />Divine Fighting Technique, Heal 10 ranks, base attack bonus +7.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Benefit</strong><br />A number of times per day equal to your Wisdom bonus, you can exacerbate any lingering contagions within a target&rsquo;s body upon making a successful melee attack with a scythe. Activating this ability is a swift action, and causes the target to immediately attempt additional saving throws against all diseases with which it is currently afflicted. Any failed saves cause the target to immediately take the effects of that disease, while a successful save does not count toward the number of consecutive saves that the target must succeed at in order to cure the disease.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Zon-Kuthon's Flensing</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Zon-Kuthon invites all mortals to join in inflicting and suffering pain.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Initial Benefit</strong><br />Once per round, when you hit a foe with a spiked chain, you can twist the chain so it painfully flenses both of you. You and your target are both sickened for 1 round, and the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom bonus) or be sickened for an additional 1d4+1 rounds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Prerequisites</strong><br />Base attack bonus +10.</p>\n<p>Must worship a single patron deity that has an established divine fighting technique.Advanced Benefit: Whenever you sicken a foe with pain using a spiked chain (whether by flensing, as a dirty trickAPG combat maneuver, or otherwise), the victim must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom bonus) or be nauseated for the first round of the duration.</p>"

			"description": "<p><em>The power of dragons flows through your veins and you have awakened its potential.</em><br /><br /><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br />Cha 13.<br /><br /><strong>Benefits</strong><br />Choose one type of dragon from the options presented below. You gain the draconic heritage ability from your chosen dragon type. The save DCs of any associated ability are equal to 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier.<br /><br /><strong>Special</strong><br />You can take this feat only once. If you ever gain a bloodrager or sorcerer bloodline, you must take draconic as your chosen bloodline (or a bloodline tied to some other creature of the dragon type, as approved by your GM).</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Pathfinder Society<br /></strong>The Chromatic heritage is not legal for play</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>True Dragons</h2>\n<p>Though it is still uncommon, true dragons are most likely to interact directly with humanoid races, though a few take on humanoid forms and move among mortals until the time is right to reveal themselves. Such dragons rarely adopt these guises for long, as those who lose themselves in humanoid form are seen as pariahs by their own kind.</p>\n<h3><strong><br />Chromatic</strong></h3>\n<p>While not all who carry the blood of chromatic dragons are evil, the potency of their blood and the malevolence inherent in it can have strong subconscious effects, tempting them to embrace their sinister urges. Humanoids with blood empowered by chromatic dragons tend toward muscular builds and can imbue their fists with the dragons&rsquo; energy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Draconic Heritage</strong><br />Choose acid, cold, electricity or fire when you take this feat; the choice cannot be changed once made. As a swift action, you can shroud your arms in your chosen element for 1 round. Unarmed strikes with your arms or hands (or attacks with weapons held in those hands) deal an additional 1d6 points of energy damage of the appropriate type. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma bonus.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Esoteric</strong></h3>\n<p>Those with the power of esoteric dragons take aloofness to an extreme and are prone to long nights of sleep and vivid, enrapturing dreams. They are often deeply empathetic and emotional individuals, feeling the needs and wants of others intimately and, in some cases, more intensely than they can handle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Draconic Heritage</strong><br />As a standard action, you can project a psychic barrage at a creature within 15 feet to which you have line of sight. A creature targeted by your psychic barrage must succeed at a Will save or be dazed for 1 round. You can attempt a psychic barrage once per day for every 4 characters levels you have (minimum 1). This is a mindaffecting effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong><br />If you have 1 or more levels in a class that casts psychic spells, you can attempt a psychic barrage a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your level in that class (minimum 1), plus one more time per day for every 4 levels you have in other classes.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Imperial</strong></h3>\n<p>Imperial dragons see themselves as masters of their respective domains, and those with heritages influenced by their legacies often have this same aggressively territorial nature. Individuals with this heritage tend to be charismatic, commanding, and proud people who have an unusual intensity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Draconic Heritage<br /></strong>As a swift action, you emit an aura of command with a 10-foot radius for 1 round. Allies within your aura gain a +2 bonus on Will saves against fear. Enemies in your aura take a &ndash;2 penalty on Will saves against fear. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma bonus.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Metallic</strong></h3>\n<p>Metallic dragons leave an impression of kindness and hope in those infused with a portion of their power. Those who bear the blood of metallic dragons sometimes have iridescent hair of pale metallic hues and irises colored like polished metal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Draconic Heritage</strong><br />Choose acid, cold, electricity, or fire when you take this feat; the choice cannot be changed once made. As a swift action, you gain energy resistance 5 against your chosen element. This energy resistance lasts until the beginning of your next turn. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma bonus.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Outer</strong></h3>\n<p>The utterly alien nature of outer dragons often conflicts with the more grounded and material upbringing of those who carry these dragons&rsquo; influence within their bloodlines. Feelings of otherness or exclusion are common among humanoids with this bloodline, and many become exiles or wanderers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Draconic Heritage</strong><br />As a swift action, you can generate an alien aura around yourself with a 5-foot radius that lasts for 1 round. Any enemy who enters your aura must succeed at a Will save or become sickened for 1 round. A creature who successfully saves against your alien aura is immune to its effects for 24 hours. You can generate an alien aura once per day for every 4 characters levels you have (minimum 1). This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Primal</strong></h3>\n<p>The scions with the power of the elementally attuned primal dragons are not often subtle in appearance. They tend towards hardy builds and skin tones that take on shimmering, iridescent hues in direct light. Additionally, they often experience tempestuous emotions that are difficult to control.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Draconic Heritage</strong><br />Choose acid, cold, electricity, or fire when you take this feat; once made, this choice cannot be changed. As a standard action, you can create a 10-footradius aura of elemental energy that lasts for 1 round. The area of this aura is considered difficult terrain, and creatures that end their turns in your aura take 1d6 points of energy damage of the appropriate type. A successful Fortitude save halves this damage but does not negate the difficult terrain effect. You can create an aura of elemental energy once per day for every 4 characters levels you have (minimum 1).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong><br />If you are a druid, hunter, or kineticist, you can create an elemental aura a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your class level (minimum 1), plus one more time per day for every 4 levels you have in other classes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Lesser Dragons</h2>\n<p>Bloodlines infused with the power of lesser dragons are exceedingly rare, as such creatures lack both the means by which to take human form (and create a blood descendant), and the magical puissance to otherwise instill their legacy into a bloodline. On the world of Triaxus, dragonkin riders form supernatural bonds with their mounts that, in rare cases, affects the riders&rsquo; children, allowing them to share in that draconic bond in a more physical manner. Other lesser draconic heritages are the result of binding dragon spirits to physical bloodlines and similar supernatural origins.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Drake</strong></p>\n<p>Creatures with drake ancestry are often swift-footed and have quick reflexes, mirroring the speed and grace of drakes. They tend to be wiry and athletic with long limbs and wild, untamed demeanors that thrive best beyond the boundaries of civilization. Befitting the variety of different drake breeds in the world, those with drake bloodlines often have hair or eye colors reminiscent of the scales of the drake breed to which they&rsquo;re related. Some might exhibit additional minor features suggestive of a specific draconic heritage, but such features provide no statistical benefit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Draconic Heritage</strong><br />As a swift action, you gain a +10 enhancement bonus to your base speed for 1 round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma bonus.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Linnorm</strong></p>\n<p>The cursed blood of linnorms is a unique case&mdash;it is sometimes passed down by those who bear a child while under the effects of a linnorm&rsquo;s death curse. Such an unlikely offspring usually bears a visible mark or scar that ties her life to the legacy of that linnorm.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Draconic Heritage</strong><br />As an immediate action when you are damaged by a melee attack, you can afflict your attacker with a curse. The target of your curse must succeed at a Will save or take a &ndash;2 penalty on all ability checks, attack rolls, and skill checks for 1 round. You can use this curse once per day for every 4 characters levels you have (minimum 1).<br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong><br />If you are a shaman or a witch, you can use this curse a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your class level (minimum 1), plus one more time per day for every 4 levels you have in other classes.</p>"

Both spells must have an elemental descriptor (air, earth, fire, or water), or an energy descriptor that corresponds to one of the elements (acid [earth], cold [water], electricity [air], or fire [fire]) . Both spells must be at least 1st level, within 1 spell level of each other, and cast during the same initiative turn through the use of readied actions.<br /><br />When the spells to be commixed are cast, one is designated as the primary spell (typically the higherlevel spell), while the other is the secondary spell. The primary spell must be an offensive spell that targets an area or one or more creatures. The secondary spell can be any spell with an appropriate descriptor. Neither spell can take more than a standard action to cast. The primary spell behaves as written (with the exception of the synergistic benefits that are described below). The secondary spell does not manifest any of its usual effects; instead, targeted creatures are affected by a secondary effect that is determined by the combination of the two spells' descriptors.<br /><br />Targeted creatures can attempt a saving throw against the primary spell as normal (assuming that a save is normally allowed), and then attempt a separate save against the secondary effect. The secondary effect's save type is described in its listing, and its save DC is equal to the normal save DC of the primary or secondary spell, whichever is lower (or, if neither spell allows a saving throw, 10 + lowest spell's level + spellcaster's primary spellcasting ability score [Int, Wis, or Cha] modifier).<br /><br />Commixed spells cannot be counterspelled normally. A creature with Improved Counterspell can counterspell commixed spells if both spells are correctly identified and both belong to the same school. Regardless, the secondary effects of two spells combined through Elemental Commixture cannot be counterspelled. Spell resistance still applies to the secondary effect, unless both of the commixed spells bypass spell resistance.<br /><br /><strong>Synergistic Benefits</strong><br />The primary spell's save DC (if any) increases by 1. If either spell is normally modified by Spell Focus or Greater Spell Focus, the bonus to save DCs granted by those feats stacks with this increase. The caster of the primary spell also gains a +1 bonus on any caster level check made to overcome spell resistance.<br /><br /><strong>Secondary Effects</strong><br />While the secondary spell has no direct effect other than bolstering the effects of the primary spell, the combination of spells also creates a unique secondary effect depending on the elemental descriptors of the commixed spells. For the purpose of this secondary effect, the acid, cold, and electricity descriptors count as earth, water, and air descriptors, respectively. Commixed spells with the same elemental descriptors do not produce a secondary effect, though the primary spell still gains the synergistic benefits described above.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dust (Air/Earth)</strong><br />Choked by dust, the targets must succeed at a Fortitude save or become staggered for 1 round plus 1 round per 5 caster levels of the secondary spell's caster. Targeted spellcasters must succeed at a concentration check to cast spells (the DC is equal to the save DC). On a successful save, the targets are not staggered but must still attempt concentration checks.</li>\n<li><strong>Lava (Earth/Fire)</strong><br />The targets are splattered with bits of molten rock and take 1d6 points of fire damage. The targets must succeed at a Reflex save or catch fire (see Catching on Fire on page 444 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</li>\n<li><strong>Mud (Earth/Water)</strong><br />The targets must succeed at a Reflex save or fall prone and have their movement speeds cut in half (to a minimum speed of 5 feet) for 1 round plus 1 round per 5 caster levels of the secondary spell's caster. On a successful save, the targets' movement speeds are cut in half for 1 round.</li>\n<li><strong>Smoke (Air/Fire)</strong><br />The targets suffer smoke inhalation and must succeed at Fortitude saves or become nauseated for 1 round and blinded for 1d4 rounds. Success negates the nausea effect and reduces the blindness to 1 round. Creatures immune to fire are immune to the nausea effect.</li>\n<li><strong>Snow (Air/Water)</strong><br />The primary spell gains the cold descriptor if it doesn't have that descriptor already, and half the damage dealt (if any) is cold damage. The targets must succeed at a Reflex save or fall prone.</li>\n<li><strong>Steam (Fire/Water)</strong><br />Damage caused by the primary spell (if any) is treated as nonlethal, untyped damage (neither cold nor fire damage) and is not affected by energy resistance or absorbed by protection from energy. The targets become blinded for 1d4 rounds unless they succeed at a Will save.</li>\n</ul>"

For his next two attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, or ability checks, he rolls twice and takes the lower result; for every 5 ranks of Bluff you possess beyond 5, this ability affects an additional roll. This is a mind-affecting effect, and it doesn't work if the target is immune to curses. Once you attempt to feign putting a curse on a creature, you cannot do so again against the same creature for 24 hours, and if the target succeeds at detecting your ruse, he gains a +10 bonus against future attempts."

Doing so adds both a somatic component (if the spell does not already have one) and a focus component (the harrow deck) to the spell, but does not increase the spell's casting time. For the duration of the spell, each summoned creature gains a +4 enhancement bonus to the corresponding ability scores of the drawn card's suits.

If either card's alignment is a true match for the summoned creatures' alignment, the duration of the spell is doubled, while drawing an opposite match halves the duration of the spell. If both a true match and an opposite match are drawn, the spell's duration is unchanged.<br/><br/> A creature summoned in this way is distinctly altered by the cards drawn.

To use holy water in a particular way, you must meet the additional requirements of that effect, such as a particular feat, ranks in a specific skill, or the ability to cast a certain spell (specified after the effect's name). Unless otherwise specified, using any of these abilities consumes one vial of holy water.<br/><br/> Blinding Water (Improved Precise Shot)<br/>By uttering a short prayer as swift action, you can empower a vial of holy water with blinding light. If you successfully throw that vial of holy water and land a direct hit against an undead creature by the end of your next turn, the target takes damage from the holy water as normal and also becomes blinded (Reflex DC 13 negates blindness). This even affects creatures that do not have eyes such as skeletons, but not creatures that don't rely on vision.<br/><br/> Concentrate Holy Water (Craft [alchemy] 4 ranks)<br/>Through alchemical processes, you can refine multiple doses of holy water into a single hyperpotent dose. To do so, you must possess two or more flasks of holy water and you must succeed at a Craft (alchemy) check that takes 10 minutes of uninterrupted time. The DC of the Craft (alchemy) check is equal to 15 + 2 x the number of doses of holy water you are combining. For example, combining three flasks of holy water would require a successful DC 21 Craft (alchemy) check. Success means you combine all of the doses into a single concentrated flask of holy water. If you fail the check by 4 or less, the distillation process failed and must be tried again. If you fail the check by 5 or more, the distillation process failed and all of the doses of holy water are wasted. The maximum number of doses of holy water you can combine is equal to half the number of ranks you possess in Craft (alchemy).<br/><br/> A direct hit with a flask of concentrated holy water deals 2d4 points of damage + 2 points of damage x the number of doses of holy water used to an undead creature or an evil outsider. Undead creatures and evil outsiders within 5 feet of where the flask hits take 1 point of damage + 1 point of damage x the number of doses of holy water used. For example, a flask of concentrated holy water made of 3 doses of holy water would deal 2d4+6 points of damage on a direct hit, and 4 points of damage to undead creatures and evil outsiders within 5 feet of the target.<br/><br/> Healing Glyph (ability to cast glyph of warding)<br/>You can replace the diamond material component in a glyph of warding spell with a vial of holy water. When you do so, you must place a spell glyph containing a conjuration (healing) spell of 3rd level or lower, which can be designed to benefit allies or harm undead.<br/><br/> Healing Water (Heal 5 ranks)<br/>You can use holy water for curative purposes. When you pour a vial of holy water over your hands, you gain a +4 bonus on Heal checks to perform first aid, treat wounds, treat poison, or treat disease in the next hour. Additionally, once per day you can drink a vial of holy water to heal yourself of 1d8 points of damage.<br/><br/> Holy Circle (ability to cast magic circle against evil)<br/>You can replace the silver material component of a magic circle against evil spell with a vial of holy water. When you do so, the duration of the spell increases 20 minutes per level instead of 10 minutes, and the Spellcraft DC to add a special diagram to the circle is 15 instead of 20.<br/><br/> Holy Water Splash (Point-Blank Shot)<br/>When you throw a flask of holy water, creatures in the area of the holy water's splash radius take 1 additional point of damage as long as they are within 30 feet of you. This ability does not stack with other effects that increase the damage dealt to creatures within the splash radius of holy water, such as the concentrate holy water ability of this feat or the empower holy water spell on page 26."

Some creatures (such as oozes, elementals, and creatures with the incorporeal quality) cannot have bombs implanted in them.

If the blast includes only one infusion, the blast uses the Constitution or Dexterity modifier of the kineticist who supplied that infusion, as appropriate for the infusion provided. If no infusions are used, the two kineticists choose one of them to provide the Dexterity modifier, and the other provides the Constitution modifier."

Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of spell.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Daylight</strong></h3>\n<p>Though many clerics in the church of Sarenrae can conjure powerful light, it was a warpriest named Amnok who learned to focus it through his shield and blind Sarenrae&rsquo;s foes. He later learned how to conjure a burst of pure daylight, shining like the sun for a several seconds and defeating an entire cabal of vampires. Most of the manipulations of the daylight spell come from Amnok&rsquo;s early work. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed in parentheses for each of these tricks, you must have the Magic Trick (daylight) feat to use the trick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Barrier of Light (Shield Focus)</strong><br />When you cast daylight on a shield, it sheds bright light in a 120-foot cone and raises the light level by one step for an additional 120 feet. As a standard action, you can end the spell by causing the light to suddenly flash, blinding each creature in the cone for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save against your daylight spell DC.</p>\n<p><strong>Blades of Light (Knowledge [religion] 6 ranks)</strong><br />When you cast daylight on a melee weapon, you can reduce the duration to 1 round per level and grant the weapon the ability to deal additional damage against undead and evil outsiders equal to 1 point per 2 caster levels (maximum +5). This extra damage does not stack with the holy weapon enchantment and similar effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Burst of Sunlight (Spellcraft 6 ranks or worship deity with Sun domain)</strong><br />You can reduce the duration of your daylight spell to 1 round, causing the spell to radiate the equivalent of pure daylight for the purpose of affecting creatures that are damaged, destroyed, or are otherwise affected by such light.</p>\n<p><strong>Convincing Halo (Knowledge [religion] 3 ranks)</strong><br />When you cast daylight on a piece of headgear, you can make it appear as a halo. This grants the creature wearing the headgear a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy and Bluff checks against good outsiders.</p>\n<p><strong>Pin Sunlight (Precise Shot)</strong><br />When you cast daylight on a piece of ammunition or thrown weapon, you can cause the spell to transfer to the target of a successful ranged attack with that piece of ammunition or thrown weapon, causing the creature to radiate light from its body. If the creature succeeds at a Will save against your daylight spell DC, it instead glows with dim light in a 5-foot radius for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Vessel of Light (no additional prerequisites)</strong><br />When you cast daylight on a torch, lantern, or other tool used to produce mundane light, you increase the duration of your spell to 1 hour per level.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Fireball</strong></h3>\n<p>Vincent the Pyroclastic is a destructive force in the Society. He has caused permanent damage to and condemnation of more buildings in the Inner Sea region than any other agent. For him, incineration became an art. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed in parentheses for each of these tricks, you must have the Magic Trick (fireball) feat to use the trick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Alchemist&rsquo;s Inferno (Craft [alchemy] 9 ranks, Spellcraft 9 ranks)</strong><br />Using alchemist&rsquo;s fire as a material component, your fireball sets everything it touches ablaze. The initial blast deals half as much damage, but targets that fail their Reflex saves also catch fire. A creature that catches fire in this way must attempt a Reflex save against the DC of the fireball spell to stop burning instead of the typical DC. Unattended objects automatically catch fire, though nonflammable objects burn for only 1 additional round.</p>\n<p><strong>Cluster Bomb (Spellcraft 6 ranks)</strong><br />You are able to throw multiple small explosions with a single spell instead of the normal effect. For every 2 caster levels, you toss a miniature fireball with a 10-foot radius that deals 2d6 points of fire damage. The grid intersection of all blasts must be within 30 feet of each other. If a creature is in the area of multiple blasts, it attempts a single Reflex save against the combined damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Concentrated Fire (Selective Spell or Widen Spell, Spellcraft 6 ranks)</strong><br />You can reduce the radius of your fireball by increments of 5 feet, to a minimum of a 5-foot radius. For each 5-foot increment you reduce the spell, you increase the spell&rsquo;s damage by 1d6. This additional damage can exceed the spell&rsquo;s maximum damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Sculpt Flames (Reach Spell, Selective Spell)</strong><br />You can alter the shape of your fireball to send its fire along the path you desire. When casting the spell, you can change the area to one 5-foot square per caster level. The spell&rsquo;s area must be continuous and unbroken when cast. If its blocked or otherwise interrupted by a 5-foot wide or larger environmental feature like a wall, the spell fails. A creature only takes damage once from a fireball cast in this way, even if the spell&rsquo;s area intersects with the creature multiple times.</p>\n<p><strong>Where There&rsquo;s Smoke (Craft [alchemy] 6 ranks, Spellcraft 6 ranks)</strong><br />Using a smokestick as a material component, you make your fireball leave behind a thick cloud of smoke in the spell&rsquo;s area for 1 minute. A moderate or stronger wind dissipates the smoke in 1 round as a smokestick. When using a smokestick in this way, your fireball deals only 1d6 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d6).</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Floating Disk</strong></h3>\n<p>Although most spellcasters use floating disks as little more than a means of moving luggage, the shulsagas of the Astral Plane have mastered the ability to ride atop a floating disk. A combination of cultural importance, astral secrets, and constant practice allows shulsagas to push the spell&rsquo;s magic beyond its normal limits. Masters of the art can perform truly extraordinary maneuvers with proper training. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Magic Trick (floating disk) feat to use the trick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Disk (Fly 3 ranks, Shield Proficiency)</strong><br />While riding atop your floating disk with at least one hand free, you can spend a move action to grip the disk by its edge, tilt it, and use it to deflect blows. Until the beginning of your next turn, your floating disk grants you the benefits of the spell shield. If you are already under the effects of the shield spell from another source, this effect instead increases the spell&rsquo;s shield bonus by 1 until the beginning of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Disk Rider (Fly 3 ranks)</strong><br />You can ride atop any floating disk you create, so long as it has the capacity to support your weight. This grants you a fly speed of 30 feet (average), but the disk cannot move itself or you more than 5 feet above the ground at any time. If you are on a location within the Astral Plane&mdash;including Yulgamot itself&mdash;the disk can instead fly to any height, and your fly speed while standing on it increases to 40 feet (good). When you cast floating disk, you can step onto the disk in your space as part of the action required to cast the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Drifting Defense (Fly 6 ranks, Mobility, Shield Proficiency)</strong><br />Whenever you move at least 10 feet during your turn, you can activate the defensive disk trick as a free action.</p>\n<p><strong>Expanded Disk (Fly 3 ranks, Heighten Spell)</strong><br />If you are Large or larger, you can create a larger floating disk capable of supporting your weight and size; however, for each size category you are larger than Medium, you must use a spell slot that is one level higher (for example, a 4th-level spell is required to create a disk capable of supporting a Gargantuan creature). Once created, a disk augmented with this trick will always support the weight of you and your personal gear, even if this combined mass exceeds the disk&rsquo;s capacity.</p>\n<p><strong>Force Check (Fly 3 ranks, Catch Off-Guard or Improved Bull Rush)</strong><br />When you successfully charge and bull rush a creature while riding atop your floating disk, you can veer the disk into your target, dealing 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage in addition to moving the target. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Armor Class against any attack of opportunity attempted against you when performing a bull rush in this way.</p>\n<p><strong>Spurn Gravity (Fly 6 ranks)</strong><br />While astride your floating disk, you can fly higher than 5 feet above the ground. However, you must return to a location 5 feet above a stable surface before the end of your turn or fall. If you take damage from this fall, you fall prone atop your floating disk. As a swift action, you can also reduce the remaining duration of your floating disk to 1 round per level. For the remaining duration of the spell, your fly speed increases to 50 feet and your disk ignores all altitude limitations.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Mage Hand</strong></h3>\n<p>Cylindia the Sly was a renowned cat burglar throughout Magnimar. Though she never had any formal magical training, her ancestor&rsquo;s magical blood was all she needed to produce and master the use of mage hand. She remains unique in that her adaptations to the spell came entirely from practical applications rather than study and experimentation. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed in parentheses for each of these tricks, you must have the Magic Trick (mage hand) feat to use the trick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Dirty Magic Trick (base attack bonus +1, Improved Dirty Trick)</strong><br />You can manipulate a target&rsquo;s clothing or a nearby object to attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver against a single opponent in the spell&rsquo;s range, using your combat maneuver bonus for the check.</p>\n<p><strong>Powerful Hand (Spellcraft 3 ranks)</strong><br />You can increase the weight of objects you can move by 5 pounds for every 3 ranks you have in Spellcraft.</p>\n<p><strong>Ranged Aid (base attack bonus +1)</strong><br />You&rsquo;ve learned to use your mage hand to tug at an opponent&rsquo;s hair, clothing, and equipment. You can use the aid another action at range, attempting a ranged touch attack instead of a melee attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Reaching Hand (Precise Shot or Reach Spell)</strong><br />You can focus as a swift action before casting mage hand to increase its range to 50 feet + 5 feet per caster level. If the target of your mage hand spell is outside of the spell&rsquo;s standard range at the start of your turn, you must spend another swift action to focus again or the spell immediately ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Subtle Hand (Deft Hands, Disable Device 6 ranks, Sleight of Hand 6 ranks)</strong><br />You can attempt Disable Device and Sleight of Hand checks within range of your mage hand. Working at a distance increases the normal skill check DC by 5, and you cannot take 10 on this check.</p>\n<p><strong>Throw Punch (Improved Unarmed Strike)</strong><br />You can use mage hand to strike an opponent within the spell&rsquo;s range. This is a melee attack that always deals 1d3 points of force damage. The mage hand has an attack bonus equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. Spell resistance applies against this ability.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Obscuring Mist</strong></h3>\n<p>Shastalla of the Shackles was a bloodthirsty pirate, famous for her raids on Chelish patrols under the cover of obscuring mist. After Shastalla was caught and executed, the Pathfinder Society purchased her magical library for a small fortune to learn her secrets. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed in parentheses for each of these tricks, you must have the Magic Trick (obscuring mist) feat to use the trick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Clinging Mist (Extend Spell, Spellcraft 6 ranks)</strong><br />Your thick mist is difficult to escape. A creature that leaves the obscuring mist continues to treat other creatures as if they had concealment for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves.</p>\n<p><strong>Hydrating Mist (Survival 3 ranks)</strong><br />Your mist clings to creatures, soaking them and their equipment. This grants each creature a +4 bonus on Fortitude saves to resist effects of heat and a &ndash;4 penalty on saves against effects that deal electricity damage and spells with the electricity descriptor. This effect functions as submersion in water for aquatic creatures and penetrates the skin, hydrating creatures in the mist as if they consumed a canteen full of water.</p>\n<p><strong>Mist Screen (Heighten Spell)</strong><br />You can shape your obscuring mist into a dense wall of mist with an area up to one 10-foot square per 2 levels. The sections of wall are 5 feet thick and must remain contiguous, but they do not need to be anchored to a solid surface. At least one section of the wall must include your space. Creatures standing within the wall have concealment. Creatures on the opposite side of the wall have total concealment.</p>\n<p><strong>Obscure Self (Stealth 6 ranks)</strong><br />You reduce the area of the obscuring mist to your space plus all adjacent squares, but the mist is no longer stationary and instead automatically moves with you when you move. This does not create enough concealment to attempt Stealth checks. As a swift action, you can anchor the mist, causing it to become stationary and allowing enough concealment to hide. You can release the mist as a swift action, allowing it to move with you again. If you take any fire damage while this trick is in effect, the spell immediately ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Obscure Terrain (Selective Spell)</strong><br />Your mist rests low to the ground, blocking sight to all underfoot and making the area difficult to traverse. Your obscuring mist takes up the same area, but no longer blocks sight of other creatures. Instead, all creatures moving through the mist treat the area as difficult terrain. A creature can spend a move action to treat the area as normal terrain until the end of its turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Quenching Mist (Spellcraft 6 ranks or water subtype)</strong><br />You can issue a forceful blast of pressurized mist in a 15-foot cone instead of casting obscuring mist normally. This blast automatically quenches any nonmagical fires and functions as dispel magic against magical fires as long as those fires are Medium or smaller. The duration changes to instantaneous and the spell gains the water descriptor. Creatures with the fire subtype within the cone take 1d6 points of damage for every 2 caster levels (maximum 5d6) you have (half on a successful Reflex save).</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Prestidigitation</strong></h3>\n<p>Though magical practitioners around the multiverse make daily use of prestidigitation, Poshment the Peculiar was the first to dabble in prestidigitation&rsquo;s many possibilities. Through dedicated study and dubious field tests, he was able to find many more uses than dying his clothes and cleaning up a spell component closet. By the time he had graduated from the Arcanamirium in Absalom, he had already learned to permanently dye clothes and even paint on canvas using only his spellwork. Over the years, he expanded prestidigitation from a multi-use spell to a work of art. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed in parentheses for each of these tricks, you must have the Magic Trick (prestidigitation) feat to use the trick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Adjust Scent (Survival 6 ranks)</strong><br />You can adjust the smell of an object or willing creature to become more or less powerful, respectively doubling or reducing by half the distance needed to detect the target with the scent universal monster ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Chromatic Savant (Disguise 3 ranks or gnome)</strong><br />When you change the color of an item, the changes are permanent. You can also change the color of part or all of a living being, but the effect gradually fades away in about a month. You must succeed at an appropriate Craft check to create complex or specific designs.</p>\n<p><strong>Lasting Changes (Extend Spell)</strong><br />The effects of your prestidigitation spells persist for 1 hour per caster level; this does not change its spell level.</p>\n<p><strong>Minor Levitation (Spellcraft 3 ranks)</strong><br />You can cause up to 1 pound of material to become weightless and direct it to move up to 5 feet each round as if under the effects of levitate.</p>\n<p><strong>Repulsive Flavor (Craft [cooking] 3 ranks)</strong><br />You can cause a willing creature to taste foul. Once a creature with a bite attack successfully attacks the target of your spell, the target gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC and CMD against bite attacks and grapple checks made with a mouth, such as the grab ability or swallow whole, from that creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Thaumaturgic Aesthetics (Bluff 3 ranks, Disguise 3 ranks, Deceptive)</strong><br />While you have a prestidigitation spell active, you can thematically change the effects of other spells you cast, such as changing the color of a fireball, granting your magic missile a specific shape, or adding a floral smell to your mage armor. This increases the DC of Spellcraft and Knowledge (arcana) checks to identify your magic by an amount equal to half of your ranks in Disguise (minimum 1).</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Shield</strong></h3>\n<p>Kah&rsquo;la is one of the more studious magi to ever graduate from the Arcanamirium. Though her professors had hoped she would make a fine magical theoretician, she joined the Pathfinder Society and put her theories on abjuration to good use. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed in parenthesis for each of these tricks, you must have the Magic Trick (shield) feat to use the trick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Friendly Shield (Bodyguard)</strong><br />When using the Bodyguard feat, you can instead grant your ally the benefit of your active shield spell. You lose the spell&rsquo;s benefits and your ally gains these benefits for the spell&rsquo;s duration.</p>\n<p><strong>Force Bash (Improved Bull Rush, Improved Shield Bash)</strong><br />While the shield spell is active, as a standard action you can cause your shield to fly toward a target within 30 feet and attempt to bash it. On a successful ranged attack roll, the spell deals 1d8 points of force damage plus 1 point per 3 caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). If it deals damage, you can also attempt a bull rush combat maneuver with the shield as a free action. The shield has an attack bonus equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. Using the shield in this way consumes 1 minute of the spell&rsquo;s duration. Spell resistance applies against this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Force Equipment (Equipment Trick [shield])</strong><br />You can use your shield spell with the Equipment Trick (shield) feat for the following tricks: Break Ground, Hurl Shield, Little Wall, Ricochet Shield, Shield Gag.</p>\n<p><strong>Instant Cover (Spellcraft 6 ranks)</strong><br />While the shield spell is active, as an immediate action you can expand your shield into a tower shield made of force. Choose one edge of your space. That edge is treated as a wall of force, except for each 2 caster levels it has hardness 5 and 5 hit points. At the end of the current creature&rsquo;s turn, the shield spell immediately ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Reflective Shield (Spellcraft 9 ranks)</strong><br />While the shield spell is active, as an immediate action you can reflect magic missile spells back on their caster as if using spell turning. Using the shield in this way consumes 1 minute of the spell&rsquo;s duration.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Unseen Servant</strong></h3>\n<p>Who better than Seganam, a conjuration professor at Korvosa&rsquo;s Acadamae, to discover a variety of applications for unseen servant. Originally he modified the spell to assist with his alchemical experiments, but over time he learned to make these servants function in a variety of ways. Today, armor-clad servants stand perpetual guard outside his office. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed in parentheses for each of these tricks, you must have the Magic Trick (unseen servant) feat to use the trick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Phantom Decoy (Disguise 6 ranks)</strong><br />Your servant can inhabit a suit of armor as if wearing it, appearing as haunted armor. This reduces the unseen servant&rsquo;s movement speed as normal armor would. Attacks against the unseen servant target an AC equal to 10 plus the armor bonus from the armor. Any successful attack damages the armor as if it were targeted by a sunder combat maneuver. An area effect that deals 6 or more points of damage destroys the unseen servant as usual.</p>\n<p><strong>Unfettered Servant (Reach Spell)</strong><br />Without increasing the spell slot, you increase the range of your unseen servant to long. If the servant moves beyond the spell&rsquo;s range, it finishes its current task before it ceases to exist.</p>\n<p><strong>Unseen Apprentice (Combat Casting, Spellcraft 3 ranks)</strong><br />You servant is gifted with a spark of magical prowess. If the servant is adjacent to you when you attempt a concentration check, you gain a +1 bonus to the check. This bonus increases to +2 when you have 10 or more ranks in Spellcraft.</p>\n<p><strong>Unseen Assistant (Craft [any], Perform [any], or Profession [any] 3 ranks)</strong><br />You infuse your servant with the spirit of creativity. It can assist you as if successfully using the aid another action with a single Craft, Profession, or Perform skill in which you have 3 or more ranks. Alternatively, it can use any of these skills itself, using half of your total bonus for that skill.</p>\n<p><strong>Unseen Squire (armor proficiency)</strong><br />Your servant can assist any character in donning armor with which you are proficient. When doing so, that character is considered as having help to don her armor and can do so in half the usual time: 5 rounds for light armor, 1 minute for medium armor, or 2 minutes for heavy armor.</p>\n<p><strong>Unseen Warrior (base attack bonus +3)</strong><br />You imbue your servant with the spirit of battle, reducing the duration to 1 round per level but allowing it to take aid another actions in battle on your turn. The servant has an attack bonus equal to your caster level plus the highest of your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifiers.</p>"

You perform an 8-hour ritual that requires the expenditure of 200 gp for rare oils, incense, and creation of a special mask. After this ritual, you forever lose all names and identities previously associated with you (including any identities that you gain from class abilities). You adopt a brief descriptive title in place of a new name. Your title must not reference the names of any people or places. (For example, you could adopt the title 'Blue Fox' or 'Twilight Stalker,' but not the title 'Chelish Avenger' or 'Spirit of the Mwangi.')<br/><br/> At the ritual's conclusion, you must don the mask created for the ritual, the appearance of which is evocative of your title. While you're wearing this mask, any attempts to scry or otherwise locate any of your eschewed identities or connect you to those identities do not work, revealing nothing but darkness, as if you were an invalid target or did not exist. Successful Knowledge checks to identify you reveal your new title rather than any old identity, but can reveal your strengths and weaknesses normally.<br/><br/> As long as you wear the ritual mask and do not reveal your connection to any past identities, any attempt to scry on you in relation to of your eschewed identities requires a successful caster level check with a DC of 10 + your Hit Dice. In addition, you are immune to effects that require the use of your name, such as the named bullet spell. While benefiting from this feat, you cannot wear any magic items in the head slot, as the mask used by this effect effectively occupies this slot (though this feat's benefits are not magical for the purpose of dispel magic and other effects). In addition, you cannot attempt to impersonate a specific individual by any means, magical or nonmagical. If you ever reveal or confirm your connection to your eschewed identities, you immediately lose the benefit of this feat and gain 1d4 permanent negative levels as your discarded identities return. You cannot regain the benefit of this feat or remove these negative levels until you atone (as per atonement, as if restoring a class feature)."

You also gain an additional benefit depending on which family you belong to. </p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Basri</strong><br />You come from the long line of ambassadors, diplomats, and travelers that make up the Basri, and your family maintains the strongest ties to the elven nation of Kyonin of any Taldan humans. Select one of the following as a bonus starting language: Celestial, Elven, Gnome, Sylvan. You gain proficiency in one of the following weapons: longbow (including composite), longsword, rapier, or shortbow (including composite). If you gain proficiency in all martial weapons at 1st level, you can instead select elven curve blade. <br /><br /><strong>Clement</strong><br />Your Garundi and Mwangi ancestors served Taldor proudly during the Sixth Army of Exploration and were awarded titles for their service. Your family, which has maintained their noble titles to this day, is known for keen insights and biting observations. You can substitute your Wisdom modifier for your Charisma modifier when attempting Diplomacy skill checks. <br /><br /><strong>Corcina</strong><br />Your family came to prominence during the Second Army of Exploration, and maintains a legacy as explorers and sailors. You gain a +1 bonus on Climb and Escape Artist checks, and a +2 bonus on Survival checks to navigate. <br /><br /><strong>Karthis</strong><br />Yours is a family of distinguished military veterans, charismatic demagogues, and xenophobic zealots. As the rest of the family becomes increasingly Imperialist, you have made no effort to remain in their good graces, but you retain the skills they taught you during a childhood of rigorous training. You can apply your Charisma modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier to Initiative checks. <br /><br /><strong>Kastner</strong><br />Your stalwart family defines itself by opposing your devil-worshiping Chelish cousins, a grudge that inspired some of Taldor's greatest healers, priests, and negotiators. You gain one additional use per day of channel energy, lay on hands, or mesmerist tricks, or 3 additional rounds of bardic music per day. You gain only one of these benefits, even if you later acquire a second class that provides one of the other class features listed. <br /><br /><strong>Lotheed</strong><br />Your family ranks include the greatest wizards and arcane scholars in Taldor, and schooling in some of the most comprehensive arcane libraries in the Inner Sea was your birthright. If your Intelligence is 11 or higher, you gain the following spell-like abilities: 1/day--dancing lights, prestidigitation, read magic, unseen servant. The caster level for these effects is equal to one-half your class level. <br /><br /><strong>Merosett</strong><br />The cunning members of your large family, a longtime fixture in Oppara's bureaucracy, specialize in tracking lineages and sidestepping red tape. You gain a +5 bonus on Bluff checks to send secret messages and Sense Motive checks to discern secret messages. You halve the time required to search through archives, navigate government offices, review contracts, or otherwise work with the complex bureaucracies your family has mastered for generations. <br /><br /><strong>Stavian</strong><br />As a close relative of the Grand Prince, yours has been a life of material comfort and indulgence, colored by constant threats and direct influence. You gain a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves against poison and on Will saves against enchantment spells of the charm and compulsion subschools. <br /><br /><strong>Talbot</strong><br />Your starkly conservative family are merchants and entrepreneurs first and aristocrats second, willing to forgo duty if they can instead pursue profit. They condemn would-be adventurers and readily oust them from the family ranks, leaving you an outcast. You gain a +2 bonus on one Profession skill of your choice. Once per day, you can use this Profession skill in place of a single Knowledge skill check. <br /><br /><strong>Varima</strong><br />Your family immigrated to Taldor from Vudra hundreds of years ago, and thanks to noble roots, extensive trade contacts, and an unparalleled skill in negotiation, soon developed into a steadfast fixture of Oppara's social scene. Whenever you use Diplomacy to influence a crowd or a room (but not individuals), you can roll twice and use the better result. <br /><br /><strong>Vernisant</strong><br />Your family is descended from the great general Arnisant, who commanded Taldan forces during the Shining Crusade... and they will never let anyone forget it! Their fierce Imperialist support and nationalist fervor has left you alienated from your relatives now, but their emphasis on scholarship left a mark nonetheless. You gain a +1 bonus on all Knowledge skills in which you have at least 1 rank. <br /><br /><strong>Vinmark</strong><br />Newcomers and outsiders, your Ulfen family was exalted to nobility 19 years ago, when Stavian III promoted your family patriarch to Baron of Oppara as a reward for service in the Ulfen Guard. Established aristocrats consider your family crude, choosing to leave them on the margins of Taldan politics unless a noble thinks they could use you to curry favor with the Grand Prince, but hard-won practicality and newborn cynicism grant you insight most Taldan nobles lack. Once per day when rolling a Sense Motive check, you may roll two dice and use the better result. <br /><br /><strong>Zespire</strong><br />Your family runs charities and lobbies heavily for social reform, leaving them with few friends among their Opparan peers but heartfelt support from the common folk and lesser nobility. You gain a +2 bonus on Diplomacy and Perform checks when dealing with common citizens and with nobles whose titles are limited to Lord, Lady, Knight, or Dame.</p>"

If you use the ability on yourself, this ability requires only a move action to activate.</p>\n<p><strong>Greater</strong> Once per day as a spell-like ability, you can use raise dead as a spell-like ability. If you use this ability on a creature that has been dead no longer than 1 minute per Hit Die you have, the creature restored to life does not incur any negative levels and does not lose its prepared spells or spell slots, nor does this ability require an expensive material component. If you use this ability on a creature that has been dead longer than 1 minute per Hit Die you have, you must supply the material component as usual, and the target is subject to the normal side effects for raise dead.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Shadow Plane</h2>\n<p><strong>Basic </strong>You can see clearly in shadowy conditions to a short range.

When casting a spell, you can perform the steps below to spontaneously apply the effects of either or both of these metamagic feats, as well as any other metamagic feats you have, to the spell without expending a higher-level spell slot. Using a feat in this way increases the spell's casting time to the casting time it would take if the character were a sorcerer or bard (sorcerers and bards using this ability increase the spell's casting time by two categories; see page 113 of the Core Rulebook); applying the Quicken Spell metamagic effect negates the increased casting time but still contributes to the modified spell's effective spell level. You can take this feat more than once; each time, select two additional metamagic feats, adding their effects to the list of possible effects you can apply to spells with this ability.<br/><br/> When casting a spell using Sacred Geometry, first determine the effective spell level of the modified spell you are attempting to cast (calculated as normal for a spell modified by metamagic feats). You can apply any number of metamagic effects to a single spell, provided you are able to cast spells of the modified spell's effective spell level.<br/><br/> <table class='inner'><tr><td><b>Effective Spell Level</b></td><td><b>Prime Constants</b></td></tr> <tr><td>1st</td><td>3, 5, 7</td></tr> <tr><td>2nd</td><td>11, 13, 17</td></tr> <tr><td>3rd</td><td>19, 23, 29</td></tr> <tr><td>4th</td><td>31, 37, 41</td></tr> <tr><td>5th</td><td>43, 47, 53</td></tr> <tr><td>6th</td><td>59, 61, 67</td></tr> <tr><td>7th</td><td>71, 73, 79</td></tr> <tr><td>8th</td><td>83, 89, 97</td></tr> <tr><td>9th</td><td>101, 103, 107</td></tr></table><br/> Refer to the Prime Constants table to determine the prime constants that can be used to cast a spell of the desired effective spell level. Then roll a number of d6s equal to the number of ranks you possess in Knowledge (engineering). Perform some combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division upon the numbers rolled that gives rise to one of the relevant prime constants. If you can produce one of the relevant prime constants, the spell takes effect with the declared metamagic effects, and you expend a spell slot of the unaltered spell's level. If you are unsuccessful, you fail to cast the spell, the action used to cast the spell is lost, and the spell slot is used up. The DC of any concentration check to cast a spell affected by this feat uses the effective spell level used to determine the prime constants, even though a successful casting of the spell does not expend a higher-level spell slot.<br/><br/> For example, suppose Ezren wants to add the enlarged and empowered effects to the magic missile he just cast. He adds the total level increases of the metamagic effects to the spell level: 2 [empower] + 1 [enlarge] + 1 [magic missile's base level] = 4, so the spell's effective level is 4. Ezren refers to the Prime Constants table, and determines that the prime constants for that effective spell level are 31, 37, and 41.<br/><br/> Since Ezren has 5 ranks in Knowledge (engineering), he rolls 5d6. The results of his dice pool are 6, 6, 4, 3 and 1. He then performs the following operations to give rise to one of the prime constants he needs: (6 x 6) + (4 - 3) x 1 = 37. Note that he could also combine the numbers as follows: ([6 + 6] x 3) + 4 + 1 = 41. He has produced one of the prime constants for the desired effective spell level, so his empowered enlarged magic missile takes effect after the full-round casting time, and uses only a 1st-level spell slot. If the result of Ezren's dice pool were 1, 1, 2, and 5, he would have been unable to produce any of the relevant prime constants. His attempt would have been unsuccessful, and he would have expended a full-round action and his prepared 1st-level magic missile spell with no effect."

If you choose a melee touch attack, you use your own melee touch attack bonus, and if you miss, the spell deals no damage. If you choose to allow the target a saving throw, a successful save means it takes half damage. The shadowy attack deals 1d6 points of damage per spell level.

		"Stylized Spell": {
			"name": "Stylized Spell",
			"description": "<p><em>You cast a spell in a distinctive manner.</em><br /><br /><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br />Bluff 5 ranks, Spellcraft 5 ranks.<br /><br /><strong>Benefits</strong><br />A stylized spell has slightly different verbal and somatic components than normal, and the spell effect appears noticeably different. The Spellcraft DC to identify a stylized spell as it is being cast is 10 higher than normal. The Knowledge (arcana) DC to identify a stylized spell, its effects, or the materials it creates is 10 higher than normal, as is the DC to recognize your magical signature with greater detect magic. When you apply this feat to a spell, you can attempt to disguise your stylized spell as another spell of the same school and subschool with the same descriptors. The other spell must be either the same spell level as the stylized spell (before applying the metamagic adjustment) or 1 spell level higher. If you do so, the stylized spell gains the ruse descriptor (see page 192) and takes on some superficial aspects of the other spell. As usual for a spell with the ruse descriptor, identification attempts that fail by 10 or less mistakenly identify it as the chosen spell (those that fail by more can't identify it at all). A stylized spell uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Stylized Magic</h2>\n<p><em>When a spellcaster casts a spell modified by the Stylized Spell metamagic feat, she can reduce the DC of the Spellcraft or Knowledge (arcana) check to identify the spell by 5 to disguise the spell in one of the following ways.<br /><br /><strong>Apparent Descriptor</strong>: </em>A stylized spell can appear to have a descriptor it lacks or appear to lack a descriptor it truly has. Changing an apparent energy descriptor changes the superficial manifestation of the energy in the spell effect but does not change the type of damage the spell deals. If the energy damages any creatures or objects, an observer who succeeds at a DC 15 Knowledge (arcana) or Perception check as a move action can identify the actual type of damage dealt based on sensory clues.<em><br /><br /><strong>Apparent School</strong>: </em>A stylized spell can appear to be of a different school or subschool when studied with detect magic.<em><br /><br /><strong>Apparent Source of Magic</strong>: </em>A stylized spell can appear to be a different type of magic--arcane, divine, or psychic. The effect is convincing only if the spellcaster provides any necessary components (such as a divine focus when imitating divine spells), and the caster must have a number of ranks in the skill associated with that type of magic equal to the spell's level. Knowledge (arcana) and Perform are associated with arcane magic, Knowledge (nature and religion) are associated with divine magic, and Bluff and Knowledge (arcana) are associated with psychic magic. A spellcaster can disguise his spell as psychic magic only if he can hide or remove the spell's verbal and somatic components (if any), such as with Conceal Spell (Ultimate Intrigue 80), Secret Signs (Pathfinder Campaigner Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide 288), Silent Spell, or Still Spell.<em><br /><br /><strong>Direction of Spell's Effect</strong>: </em>A stylized spell effect that visibly originates from the caster (such as a ray, magic missile, or fireball bead) can instead appear to originate from another point within 30 feet of the caster. There must be clear lines of effect between each of the caster, the new origin point, and the destination. If the spell effect instead fills an area that originates from the caster (such as a line or cone), the effect can instead appear to originate from any point in that area. The new point of origin is entirely cosmetic, and it does not allow the spellcaster to ignore cover or other barriers. In addition, the deception can't make it appear that another creature cast the spell.<em><br /><br /><strong>Imitate a Dissimilar Spell</strong>: </em>If a stylized spell appears to be of the same school and same source of magic, and to have the same descriptors as another spell because of other stylized spell modifications or changes from other sources (such as a class ability), the stylized spell can take on the superficial visual and auditory properties of the other spell.<em><br /><br /><strong>Suppress Audible or Visible Effects</strong>: </em>A stylized spell's effects can be suppressed to the point where they are difficult to spot or hear. Such a spell's audible and visual effects are largely transparent, quieter, smaller, or otherwise less obtrusive. A creature notices the suppressed effects only if it succeeds at a Perception check (DC = 10 + your number of ranks in Bluff or Spellcraft + the highest of your Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma modifiers). If, at the GM's discretion, a spell's effects are intrinsically bound to its visual or auditory signature (such as sunburst, sound burst, and most spells with the language-dependent, light, or sonic descriptors), reduce the DC of the Perception by 10.</p>"

This attack can be delivered via touch or a ray, as a standard action. A melee symbolic bolt requires a melee touch attack that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, and a ranged symbolic bolt is a ranged attack with a range of 30 feet.

If a symbolic bolt is used to deal untyped damage, the bolt's damage is reduced to an amount equal to 1d3 + 1/2 your total number of ranks in Use Magic Device.<br /><br />When you create a symbolic bolt, it originates from the hand holding the holy symbol and appears only briefly, so you have a hand free anytime you're not attacking with a symbolic bolt.

The potion can still be consumed normally, but it can also be delivered by throwing it at another creature as a splash weapon. The potion vial has a range increment of 10 feet and is considered an improvised weapon. On impact, the vial breaks and a cloud of barely visible potion vapor fills the square it lands in (this vapor does not obscure normal sight in any way). If a creature is in that square, it gains the benefits of the potion immediately as though it had imbibed the potion.<br/><br/> Otherwise, the vapor persists for 1d3+1 rounds in only that square before dissipating, and the first creature to enter the square before the vapor dissipates gains the potion's benefits. A creature entering the vapor's space can hold its breath to refrain from inhaling the potion. No more than one creature can benefit from a potion's vapor, and if more than one creature is in the potion's space after it is thrown, the potion is wasted and has no effect. The thrown potion deals no damage to creatures or objects it hits. A spell brewed into a potion this way does not use up a higher-level spell slot than the spell's actual level.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Versatile Brewing</b><br/>The above feat allows potion brewers to concoct unusual variations in their potions, altering the potions' effects in strange and useful ways. This feat functions similarly to metamagic feats, though it affects the creation of potions instead of the normal casting of spells. Level limits for potions apply to their level after the application of any relevant metamagic feats (if the feat affects the component spell's level)."

		"Variant Prayer Scroll": {
			"name": "Variant Prayer Scroll",
			"description": "<em>You have learned the secret to changing the powers granted by your prayer scroll.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>Jiang-shi.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>You gain the ability to create a different type of prayer scroll. You may create a prayer scroll with this ability by using any strip of parchment and a writing instrument, but doing so requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted work. Swapping your current prayer scroll for a different prepared one is a standard action. When wearing a different prayer scroll, you gain its special abilities, but lose your normal prayer scroll's immunity to spell completion and spell trigger magic items. Your prayer scrolls can be used only by you, and have no effect when used by other jiang-shis. When you choose this feat, select one of the following prayer scroll types.<br/><br/> Embalmed Form<br/>This prayer scroll alters your physical form to how you looked 1 day before your death. Treat this as an alter self spell that affects you regardless of your original or current type; your caster level is equal to your Hit Dice. Your speed increases by 10 feet, but you lose your immunity to trip attacks and your ability to move through difficult terrain unhindered. These effects persist indefinitely as long as you wear the prayer scroll, but end immediately if you use a different prayer scroll or 24 hours after you remove this prayer scroll.<br/><br/> Enduring Dust<br/>If you crumble into dust from hit point damage, you reform after 1 round instead of 1 minute. Scattering your dust does not prevent you from reforming as long none of your dust is more than 30 feet from any other part of your dust. Storing a portion of your dust in an air-tight container prevents you from reforming. If you are unable to reform after 1 minute, you are destroyed.<br/><br/> Positive Energy Immunity<br/>You become immune to positive channeled energy used to harm undead. This does not protect you against positive energy from other sources such as cure spells or lay on hands.<br/><br/> Spell Immunity<br/>The prayer scroll grants you immunity to a spell, as if you were using spell immunity. You decide which spell when you create the prayer scroll, and can choose a different spell each time you create a new spell immunity prayer scroll. If you have 15 or more Hit Dice, this functions as greater spell immunity. Creating this type of prayer scroll costs 100 gp x the spell level of the spell keyed to the scroll.<br/><br/><b>Special</b><br/>You may select this feat multiple times. Each time you do so, choose another ability granted by the feat."

			"description": "<em>You made a good name for yourself in the Pathfinder Society in part because you knew how to prepare for the challenges before you, even if your natural magical abilities lend themselves less to preparation and more to spontaneity.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>Int 13 or Wis 13 (see Special), ability to spontaneously cast 2nd-level spells.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>When you regain spell slots at the start of the day, you may opt to prepare one spell you don't know in place of a daily spell slot 1 level higher than the prepared spell's level. To do so, you must have access to the selected spell on a scroll or in a spellbook, and the spell must be on your spell list (even if it is not one of your spells known). This process takes 10 minutes per spell level of the selected spell. You can cast the selected spell a single time, expending the spell slot as though it were a known spell being cast by you. Preparing a spell in this manner expends a scroll but not a spellbook. A spell prepared in this way is considered its actual level rather than the level of the spell slot expended. You can apply metamagic feats to the spell as normal, as long as the spell's actual level plus the increases from metamagic feats is 1 level lower than the highest-level spell you can cast. For example, a 12th-level sorcerer with this feat, a scroll of fireball, and the Empower Spell metamagic feat could prepare an empowered fireball spell in her 6th-level spell slot.<br/><br/><b>Special</b><br/>If you spontaneously cast arcane spells, you must have an Intelligence score of at least 13 to take this feat. If you spontaneously cast divine spells, you must have a Wisdom score of at least 13 to take this feat. If you have both arcane and divine spellcasting classes, you can use this feat to prepare a spell using a given class's spell slot as long as you meet the associated ability score prerequisite."

If the armor has the broken condition after you damage it, the foe must continue making this save every round until he removes the armor or the armor loses the broken condition. If the armor is destroyed by your sunder attempt, the foe is automatically fatigued for 1 round. The foe cannot become exhausted this way.<br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Two-Handed Menace (Intimidate 5 ranks)</strong><br />Capitalizing on the fear inspired by massive weapons, you can take 10 on Intimidate checks even when distracted or in combat.<br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Warding Weapon (Combat Expertise)</strong><br />While you are using the total defense action, fighting defensively, or using Combat Expertise, you gain a +1 shield bonus to AC.<br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>One-Handed Lunge (base attack bonus +6)</strong><br />Martial Arts Handbook pg. 14 As a standard action, you can release one of your hands holding a two-handed weapon and make a melee attack with the weapon, increasing your reach by 5 feet for the duration of the attack. If the attack hits, you deal damage as if using a one-handed weapon, adding only your Strength bonus to damage if you are using your primary hand or half your Strength bonus if you are using your off hand, instead of 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus. Otherwise, you take no penalty for using the weapon one-handed. The extra reach doesn&rsquo;t stack with the Lunge feat or other effects that extend your melee reach beyond that granted by your size category.<br /><br /></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Two-Weapon Tricks</h2>\n<p>These weapon tricks are common among the pirates of the Shackles, the Shoanti, and natives of Northern Casmaron and Garund. You can use these tricks only while wielding two weapons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Arm Bind (Two-Weapon Defense, Two-Weapon Fighting)</strong><br />You can attempt a combat maneuver check to disarm a foe even if the foe has no weapons. This functions as the disarm combat maneuver. If you succeed and the foe has no weapon, you ensnare an arm of your choice, preventing your foe from using that limb until the end of your next turn. A foe can take a standard action to free its arm.<br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Dual Strike (Double Slice, Improved Vital Strike)</strong><br />As a standard action, you can make two attacks, one with each weapon you&rsquo;re wielding, applying the normal penalties for two-weapon fighting to each.<br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Off-Hand Opportunity (Combat Reflexes)</strong><br />You can make one additional attack of opportunity each round with your off-hand weapon.<br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Piercing Climb (Climb 8 ranks)</strong><br />You can use piercing weapons to climb as if your hands were free. You take a &ndash;4 penalty on Stealth checks while doing so. You can take 10 on such Climb checks even while distracted or endangered.<br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Weapon Juggle (Two-Weapon Fighting)</strong><br />Martial Arts Handbook pg. 14 You can draw a weapon even while wielding two weapons. Doing so takes the same type of action as drawing that weapon normally would. As part of the action to draw the weapon, you must sheathe one of the two weapons you were wielding.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Weapon and Shield Tricks</h2>\n<p>These weapon tricks are common in Taldor, where they are used by rondelero fighters, and Lastwall, where they are taught in the Crusader&rsquo;s War College. You can use these tricks only while wielding a shield and a weapon you can wield in one hand.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Confounding Shield (Bluff 5 ranks)</strong><br />You can always take 10 on Bluff checks to feint in combat.</p>\n<p><strong>Feint and Bash (Improved Feint, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Bluff 10 ranks)</strong><br />When you feint successfully against a foe you threaten with your shield, that foe provokes an attack of opportunity from you. You can only perform a shield bash with this attack of opportunity.<br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Shielded View (Knowledge [dungeoneering] 1 rank)</strong><br />When you avert your eyes to avoid a gaze attack, you have an 80% chance to avoid having to attempt a saving throw against the gaze.<br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Warded Movement (Dodge)</strong><br />As a swift action, you can choose a foe you can see. You can pass through that foe&rsquo;s threatened area without provoking attacks of opportunity from that foe this round. Once you target a foe with this trick, you can&rsquo;t target it again that day.<br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Block and Counter (Two-Weapon Fighting)</strong><br />Martial Arts Handbook pg. 14 You can ready a standard action to block an attack with your shield, making an attack roll as though you were making a shield bash and using the result as your AC against that attack. If you successfully block the attack, you can attack that opponent with the weapon in your other hand as an immediate action.<br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Shield Charge (Shield Focus, Double Slice, base attack bonus +11)</strong><br />Martial Arts Handbook pg. 14 When you make a charge attack, you can attack twice&mdash;once with your shield and once with the weapon you are wielding in your other hand, applying the normal penalties for fighting with two weapons to each.</p>"
